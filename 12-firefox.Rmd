# Firefox Policy {#firefox}

Firefox Policy deploys a `policies.json` file to client machines to customize how Firefox looks and operates.

This policy is physically stored on the SYSVOL in **MACHINE/Registry.pol**. It is stored in registry format. See chapter \@ref(regpol) for details on how to manually modify this file.

## Server Side Extension

The Server Side Extension (SSE) for Firefox Policy is distributed via Administrative Templates (see chapter \@ref(sse) in section \@ref(admx)). This SSE uses the admx templates provided by Mozilla. See https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/releases for the latest release of Mozilla's templates.

## Managing Firefox Policy via the GPME

Open the GPME and navigate to `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Mozilla > Firefox`.

There are many options to choose from, but for this example we'll just test setting a homepage. Click on `Home page` in the tree, and we're going to modify both the `Start Page` and the `URL for Home page`.

![Start Page](firefox-images/start-page.png)

First we'll set the `Start Page` to `Homepage (Locked)`. This requires the start page to always open the homepage, and the user will be unable to change it to point anywhere else.

![Home Page](firefox-images/home-page.png)

Next we'll set the homepage URL, and check the box `Don't allow the homepage to be changed`. This will prevent the user from changing the homepage.

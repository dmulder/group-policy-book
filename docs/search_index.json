Samba is a popular opensource tool that allows Linux systems to integrate with Windows environments, particularly when it comes to file and printer sharing. One of the key features of Samba is its ability to apply Group Policy objects (GPOs) to Linux clients. Group Policy is a feature of the Microsoft Windows operating system that allows administrators to centrally manage system and user settings. With Samba, Linux users can take advantage of this powerful tool to centrally manage and configure their systems. In this book, we will introduce the reader to the basics of Group Policy and show how to use Samba to apply GPOs to Linux clients. We will cover topics such as configuring Samba’s Group Policy Server Side Extensions (SSE), troubleshooting common issues with Client Side Extensions (CSEs), and how to create and apply your own Group Policy. By the end of this book, the reader should have a good understanding of how to use Group Policy with Linux systems and be able to confidently manage their Linux clients using this powerful tool. 1.1 About the Author David Mulder is a developer known for his work on integrating Group Policy support into Samba, which has allowed Linux users to take advantage of this powerful feature to centrally manage their systems. Mulder’s work on Samba’s Group Policy support began in 2016, when he began reviewing code from Luke Morrison, an intern who had submitted his implementation of Group Policy to the Samba project. Mulder previously contributed to the Vintela Group Policy project begining in 2012, and brought that expertice to the Samba team.

Samba’s Group Policy support is designed to be similar to what is offered by proprietary tools, such as Vintela’s and Centrify’s Group Policy solutions. This allows Linux users to take advantage of the same powerful Group Policy features that are available to Windows users, without having to rely on proprietary tools. Overall, Samba’s Group Policy support makes it possible for Linux users to manage and configure their systems using the same powerful Group Policy features that are available to Windows users. This allows Linux users to easily integrate their systems with Windows environments and take advantage of Group Policy’s central management capabilities. 2.1 What’s the difference between Group Policy and a Group Policy Object? The key difference between Group Policy and a Group Policy Object (GPO) is that Group Policy is the overall concept and framework for managing and configuring settings on computers in an environment, while a GPO is a specific collection of settings that are applied to a group of machines or users. Group Policy allows administrators to define and manage the settings that are applied to computers and users in a domain. This includes settings for various aspects of the operating system, such as security policies, user accounts, and network settings. Group Policy also includes the infrastructure and tools for distributing and applying these settings to the appropriate computers and users. You can think of Group Policy like a template for a work order. A GPO, on the other hand, is a specific set of settings that are defined by an administrator and applied to a group of computers or users. A GPO can be thought of as a filled out copy of a work order that specifies the settings that should be applied to the members of the group. These settings are stored in the GPO and distributed to the appropriate computers and users by the Group Policy infrastructure. Server-side extensions (SSEs) are responsible for processing and managing GPOs on the domain controller, while client-side extensions (CSEs) are responsible for applying the settings in a GPO to the local system. Together, these components work to manage and apply GPOs in an environment. 2.2 Server Side Extensions The purpose of a Server Side Extension (SSE) is to process and manage Group Policy objects (GPOs) on the domain controller (to fill out a work order). In a Windows environment, this generally refers to some component of the Group Policy Management Editor. Group Policy Management Editor In the case of Samba, SSEs also include the samba-tool gpo command, which allows administrators to manage GPOs from the command line. This command allows administrators to create, link, and modify GPOs. &gt; samba-tool gpo Usage: samba-tool gpo &lt;subcommand&gt; Group Policy Object (GPO) management. Options: -h, --help show this help message and exit Available subcommands: aclcheck - Check all GPOs have matching LDAP and DS ACLs. admxload - Loads samba admx files to sysvol backup - Backup a GPO. create - Create an empty GPO. del - Delete a GPO. dellink - Delete GPO link from a container. fetch - Download a GPO. getinheritance - Get inheritance flag for a container. getlink - List GPO Links for a container. list - List GPOs for an account. listall - List all GPOs. listcontainers - List all linked containers for a GPO. manage - Manage Group Policy Objects restore - Restore a GPO to a new container. setinheritance - Set inheritance flag on a container. setlink - Add or update a GPO link to a container. show - Show information for a GPO. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage Usage: samba-tool gpo manage &lt;subcommand&gt; Manage Group Policy Objects Options: -h, --help show this help message and exit Available subcommands: access - Manage Host Access Group Policy Objects files - Manage Files Group Policy Objects issue - Manage Issue Group Policy Objects motd - Manage Message of the Day Group Policy Objects openssh - Manage OpenSSH Group Policy Objects scripts - Manage Scripts Group Policy Objects security - Manage Security Group Policy Objects smb_conf - Manage smb.conf Group Policy Objects sudoers - Manage Sudoers Group Policy Objects symlink - Manage symlink Group Policy Objects When working with Linux clients, using samba-tool gpo manage to fill out your GPO is generally the preferred method. Overall, the purpose of an SSE is to manage and process GPOs on the domain controller, enabling administrators to define and apply settings to the appropriate computers and users in the domain. These extensions work behind the scenes to ensure that GPOs are processed and managed correctly on the domain controller. 2.2.1 Enabling Group Policy Server Side Extensions on the Server In order to use the Samba Administrative Templates in the Group Policy Management Console, you’ll need to install them first, using the command sudo samba-tool gpo admxload -UAdministrator. See chapter 21 for specifics on how to do this. 2.3 Client Side Extensions In Group Policy vernacular, a Client Side Extension (CSE) is an encapsulated module on a client machine intended to enforce a specific policy. The responsibility of the CSE is to install that policy on the client and ensure it is enforced. It’s also the responsibility of the CSE to remove the policy when disabled by the server. In Samba, a CSE looks like a single python file. Within that file, the CSE inherits from one of several base classes provided by Samba which provide settings from the server. This is discussed in more detail in chapter 19.2. 2.3.1 Enabling Group Policy Client Side Extensions on the Linux Client To enable Group Policy in Winbind, set the apply group policies global smb.conf option to Yes. You can even deploy this setting from Group Policy smb.conf options, then running the apply command manually the first time with sudo samba-gpupate --force. Policies are enforced at a random interval between 90 and 120 seconds. Policies can be manually enforced at any time on a Linux domain member using the samba-gpupdate --force command. Winbind will enforce both machine policy (as of Samba 4.14) and user policy (as of Samba 4.18). If the Linux client is joined using SSSD, you can instead enforce the policy using oddjob-gpupdate. The samba-gpupdate command from Samba must also be installed. 2.3.2 Resultant Set of Policy A Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) is a summary of the policies that will be applied to a computer or user, or that have already been applied. The RSoP is generated by the client-side extensions (CSEs) that are responsible for applying Group Policy objects (GPOs) to the local system. Each CSE is configured to return an RSoP for the policies that it manages. The RSoP is generated by the CSEs before the GPOs are applied, allowing administrators to see what policies will be applied to the system before they are actually applied. This can be useful for troubleshooting or for verifying that the correct policies are being applied. Once the GPOs are applied, the CSEs will also generate an RSoP for the policies that have been applied. To see the RSoP, run the command sudo samba-gpupdate --rsop for Machine policy, or sudo samba-gpupdate --rsop --target=User -U&lt;username&gt; to see User policy. linux-h7xz:~ # samba-gpupdate --rsop Resultant Set of Policy Computer Policy GPO: Default Domain Policy ============================================================ CSE: gp_sec_ext ------------------------------ ------------------------------ CSE: gp_sec_ext ------------------------------ ------------------------------ CSE: gp_scripts_ext ------------------------------ ------------------------------ CSE: gp_sudoers_ext ------------------------------ Policy Type: Sudo Rights ------------------------------ [ tux ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL ] ------------------------------ ------------------------------ CSE: gp_smb_conf_ext ------------------------------ Policy Type: smb.conf ------------------------------ [ apply group policies ] = 1 [ client max protocol ] = SMB2_02 ------------------------------ ------------------------------ CSE: gp_msgs_ext ------------------------------ Policy Type: /etc/motd ------------------------------ This message is distributed by Samba! ------------------------------ Policy Type: /etc/issue ------------------------------ Samba Group Policy \\s \\r \\l ------------------------------ ------------------------------ ============================================================ 2.4 Policies Introduced in this Book In the upcoming chapters of this book, we will be discussing a variety of Group Policies that can be used to manage and configure systems in a Linux environment. These policies cover a wide range of settings, including security policies, user account settings, preferences, and many others. This section will provide a brief overview of those policies. By the end of this book, the reader should have a good understanding of how to use these policies to manage and configure Linux systems. 2.4.1 smb.conf Policies These policies distribute smb.conf global options to the client. These are found in the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; smb.conf. This policy is unable to apply idmap policies. 2.4.2 Password and Kerberos Policies Password and Kerberos policies are found in the GPME under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; OS Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Account Policy. These policies are only applicable to Samba Active Directory Domain Controllers. 2.4.3 Script Policies Script policies create cron jobs on client machines which execute the specified commands. These are found in the GPME under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings &gt; Scripts. 2.4.3.1 Centrify Crontab Entries Samba provides an extension which adds compatibility with Centrify’s Crontab Entries Group Policy. If you are currently using Centrify Group Policy to distribute Crontab entry policies, these will automatically be applied by samba-gpupdate. 2.4.4 Startup Script Policies Startup script policies allow you to upload the script that will be executed to the SYSVOL, as well as scheduling the command to run at startup. These scripts can be set using the samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup command. 2.4.5 Files Policy The Files policy deploys files to client machines. These files are uploaded to the SYSVOL via the samba-tool gpo manage files command. 2.4.6 Symlink Policies The symlink policy creates symbolic links on client machines. This policy is set via the samba-tool gpo manage symlink command. This policy is compatible with Vintela’s Symlink Group Policy. 2.4.7 Sudoers Policies Sudoers policies add sudo rules to client machines. These policies can be managed in the GPME under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings &gt; Sudo Rights. 2.4.7.1 VGP Sudoers Policies Another Sudoers extension is available for compatibility with Vintela’s Sudoers Group Policy. The policy for this extension can be modified using the samba-tool gpo manage sudo command. 2.4.7.2 Centrify Sudoers Policies A third Sudoers extension is available to provide compatibility with Centrify’s Sudoers Group Policy. If you are currently using Centrify Group Policy to distribute Sudoers policies, these will automatically be applied by samba-gpupdate. Samba Sudoers, VGP Sudoers, and Centrify Sudoers policies can be safely used in conjunction with one another, since these policies are non-overlapping. 2.4.8 Message Policies Message policies set the contents of the /etc/motd and /etc/issue files on client machines. These policies can be managed in the GPME under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings &gt; Messages. 2.4.8.1 VGP Message Policies Other VGP Message extensions are available for compatibility with Vintela’s MOTD and Issue Group Policies. The policies for these extensions can be modified using the samba-tool gpo manage motd and samba-tool gpo manage issue commands. Beware that applying both the Samba and VGP message policies will cause unpredictable behavior, since both policies will apply and will overwrite one another. 2.4.9 PAM Access Policies PAM Access policies set access rules within /etc/security/access.d. These policies are set using the samba-tool gpo manage access command. This policy is compatible with Vintela’s Access Group Policy. 2.4.10 Certificate Auto Enrollment Certificate Auto Enrollment allows devices to enroll for certificates from Active Directory Certificate Services. Certificate Auto Enrollment is available in Samba 4.16 and above. 2.4.11 Firefox Policy Firefox policies can be administered using the Mozilla policy templates provided by Mozilla. 2.4.12 Chromium/Chrome Policy Chromium and Google Chrome policies can be administered using the Chrome policy templates provided by Google. 2.4.13 GNOME Settings GNOME Settings policies are found in the GPME under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; GNOME. These policies manage some GNOME user settings, as described in the GNOME system admin guide, such as the compose key, screen dimming, online account management, extensions, and the ability to disable printing, file saving, command line access, fingerprint logon, logout, user switching, and reparitioning. There is also a general method for disabling any specific GNOME lockdown value. 2.4.14 OpenSSH Policy OpenSSH policy applies settings to /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d. These policies can be set using the samba-tool gpo manage openssh command. These policies are compatible with Vintela’s OpenSSH Group Policy. 2.4.15 Firewalld Policy Firewalld policy applies firewall rules using the firewall-cmd command. These policies can be found in the GPME under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings &gt; Firewalld.

A Windows Active Directory Administrator should know that Group Policies are managed via the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC). Unfortunately there isn’t a similar tool for Samba Active Directory Administrators. The Samba project does provide the comprehensive samba-tool gpo command, which supplants much of the GPMC. There are instances where Samba’s Group Policy can only be managed via the GPMC, with no samba-tool gpo alternative. These cases will be highlighted in the text. 3.1 Opening a Group Policy Object in the Group Policy Management Console To open the Default Domain Policy (for example) in the Group Policy Management Console: Open the Group Policy Management Console by going to Start &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Group Policy Management. In the Group Policy Management Console, expand the Forest node, then expand the Domains node. Select the domain that contains the Default Domain Policy. Group Policy Management Console In the right pane, right-click on the Default Domain Policy and select “Edit” from the context menu. The Group Policy Management Editor window will open, allowing you to view and edit the Default Domain Policy. Default Domain Policy Note: You will need to have the appropriate permissions to edit the Default Domain Policy. If you do not have the necessary permissions, you will not be able to edit the policy. 3.2 Creating a Group Policy Object The samba-tool gpo create command is used to create a Group Policy Object. The samba-tool gpo create command is used to create a Group Policy Object (GPO). To create a GPO using the samba-tool gpo create command, you would use the following syntax: samba-tool gpo create GPO_NAME Where GPO_NAME is the name of the GPO that you want to create. This name should be unique within the domain, as it will be used to identify the GPO when it is linked to a domain or organizational unit (OU). Once the GPO has been created, you can use the samba-tool gpo setlink command to add or update a GPO link to a container. The syntax for this command is: samba-tool gpo setlink CONTAINER_DN GPO_NAME Where CONTAINER_DN is the distinguished name of the container from which you want to create the GPO link, and GPO_NAME is the name of the GPO you want to link. 3.3 Deleting a Group Policy Object To delete a Group Policy Object (GPO), you would use the samba-tool gpo del command. The syntax for this command is: samba-tool gpo del GPO_NAME Where GPO_NAME is the name of the GPO you want to delete. This command will delete the GPO from the server. Keep in mind that this operation cannot be undone, so make sure you really want to delete the GPO before running this command. To delete a Group Policy Object (GPO) link from a container, you would use the samba-tool gpo dellink command. The syntax for this command is: samba-tool gpo dellink CONTAINER_DN GPO_NAME Where CONTAINER_DN is the distinguished name of the container from which you want to delete the GPO link, and GPO_NAME is the name of the GPO you want to unlink. 3.4 Listing a Group Policy To list the contents of a Group Policy Object (GPO), you would use the samba-tool gpo list command. The syntax for this command is: samba-tool gpo list GPO_NAME Where GPO_NAME is the name of the GPO you want to list the contents of. This command will list all of the settings and policies contained in the specified GPO. 3.5 Modifying a Group Policy The samba-tool gpo manage is used for modifying settings on a Group Policy Object. See the individual chapters for each subcommand explanation. Command Chapter samba-tool gpo manage smb_conf 4 samba-tool gpo manage security 5 samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup 7 samba-tool gpo manage files 8 samba-tool gpo manage symlink 9 samba-tool gpo manage sudoers 10 samba-tool gpo manage issue 11 samba-tool gpo manage motd 11 samba-tool gpo manage access 12 samba-tool gpo manage openssh 17 Each of these subcommands has its own set of options and parameters that can be used to specify the details of the operation. For more information on a specific subcommand, you can consult the documentation for that subcommand. "],["smbconf.html", "4 smb.conf Policies 4.1 Server Side Extension 4.2 Client Side Extension", " 4 smb.conf Policies The purpose of the smb.conf policies is to be able to distribute smb.conf settings to Linux clients. This policy only supports a physical smb.conf file, and currently does not support smb.conf registry settings. These policies are physically stored on the SYSVOL in the MACHINE/Registry.pol file in the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. They are stored in registry format, and are difficult to modify manually. See chapter 20 for details on how to manually modify this file. 4.1 Server Side Extension The Server Side Extension for smb.conf policies is distributed using Administrative Templates (ADMX). Refer to chapter 19.1 in section 19.1.1 for details about Administrative Templates. Setting up the ADMX templates for this policy is described in chapter 21 section 21.1. 4.1.1 Managing smb.conf Policies via the GPME After successfully installing the ADMX templates, open the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME). For instructions on accessing the GPME, see chapter 3 section 3.1. For this example, we’re going to enable the apply group policies setting. In the left pane of the GPME, navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; smb.conf. smb.conf Server Side Extension (ADMX) In the right pane, double-click the “apply group policies” policy. In the “apply group policies” dialog box, click the Enabled option. Check the box next to “apply group policies”. Click OK to close the “Apply group policies” dialog box. apply group policies Setting Note: The apply group policies setting instructs Winbind to execute the samba-gpupdate command on the Group Policy interval (every 90 to 120 minutes). This allows you to apply Group Policy updates to Samba clients without having to log off and log back on. There are many other settings available here, but notice that idmap policies are not. That’s because idmap policies modify the setting name (not just the value), so these couldn’t be included. 4.1.2 Managing smb.conf Policies via samba-tool Setting an smb.conf Group Policy via samba-tool is arguably much simpler. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage smb_conf set --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage smb_conf set &lt;gpo&gt; &lt;setting&gt; &lt;value&gt; [options] Sets a Samba smb.conf Group Policy to the sysvol This command sets an smb.conf setting to the sysvol for applying to winbind clients. Not providing a value will unset the policy. Example: samba-tool gpo manage smb_conf set {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} &#39;apply gpo policies&#39; yes This command does not require the ADMX templates to be installed, and also does not suffer from the same limitation as the GPME for idmap policies. 4.2 Client Side Extension The smb.conf Client Side Extension (CSE) directly modifies the default smb.conf file. Any custom formatting or comments in the smb.conf file may be overwritten. The CSE will open your existing smb.conf file, read in the current settings, set the settings provided by the GPO, then write the file back to disk. This CSE will only write global smb.conf options. In the previous section, we enabled the apply group policies smb.conf option. If we now go to our Linux client, and check the Resultant Set of Policy, we see this: &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --rsop Resultant Set of Policy Computer Policy GPO: Default Domain Policy ================================================================= CSE: gp_smb_conf_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: smb.conf ----------------------------------------------------------- [ apply group policies ] = 1 ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- ================================================================= If we now force the policy, we’ll see our setting gets applied to the default smb.conf: &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --force &gt; diff -u /etc/samba/smb.conf.BAK /etc/samba/smb.conf --- /etc/samba/smb.conf.BAK +++ /etc/samba/smb.conf @@ -1,5 +1,6 @@ # Global parameters [global] + apply group policies = Yes kerberos method = secrets and keytab logon drive = P: logon home = \\\\%L\\%U\\.9xprofile If for whatever reason the policy did not apply, it is sometimes helpful to look at the Group Policy Cache, which keeps track of applied policies. &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &quot;TESTSYSDM$&quot; | sed -r &quot;s/\\\\\\22/\\&quot;/g&quot; | xmllint --format - &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; &lt;gp&gt; &lt;user name=&quot;TESTSYSDM$&quot;&gt; &lt;guid value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;&gt; &lt;gp_ext name=&quot;smb.conf&quot;&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;apply group policies&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/attribute&gt; &lt;/gp_ext&gt; &lt;/guid&gt; &lt;applylog&gt; &lt;guid count=&quot;0&quot; value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;/&gt; &lt;/applylog&gt; &lt;/user&gt; &lt;/gp&gt; Where TESTSYSDM$ is the system name.

"],["sec.html", "5 Password and Kerberos Policies 5.1 Server Side Extension 5.2 Client Side Extension", " 5 Password and Kerberos Policies The purpose of these policies is to enforce password complexity and kerberos rules on a Samba Active Directory Domain Controller (ADDC). When a Linux client is not an ADDC, these policies are disabled and ignored automatically. These policies are physically stored on the SYSVOL in the MACHINE/Microsoft/Windows NT/SecEdit/GptTmpl.inf file in the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. They are stored in ini format, and are easily modified manually using a text editor. 5.1 Server Side Extension The Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) contains a built in Server Side Extension for Password and Kerberos Policies.

The Password policies (internally known as System Access) apply password complexity rules directly to the ADDC SamDB in the applicable LDAP attributes. The Kerberos policies are stored in our Group Policy Cache, and are fetched directly by the samba daemon when it loads. In the previous section we saw that our Password and Kerberos policies were already initialized to some defaults.

Let’s now force a policy apply, and check that the settings have changed. &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --force &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &quot;TESTSYSDM$&quot; | sed -r &quot;s/\\\\\\22/\\&quot;/g&quot; | xmllint --format - &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; &lt;gp&gt; &lt;user name=&quot;TESTSYSDM$&quot;&gt; &lt;guid value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;&gt; &lt;gp_ext name=&quot;System Access&quot;&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;minPwdAge&quot;/&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;maxPwdAge&quot;/&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;minPwdLength&quot;/&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;pwdProperties&quot;/&gt; &lt;/gp_ext&gt; &lt;gp_ext name=&quot;Kerberos Policy&quot;&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;kdc:user_ticket_lifetime&quot;/&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;kdc:renewal_lifetime&quot;/&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;kdc:service_ticket_lifetime&quot;/&gt; &lt;/gp_ext&gt; &lt;/guid&gt; &lt;applylog&gt; &lt;guid count=&quot;0&quot; value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;/&gt; &lt;/applylog&gt; &lt;/user&gt; &lt;/gp&gt; &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &#39;kdc:user_ticket_lifetime&#39;; echo 10 &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &#39;kdc:service_ticket_lifetime&#39;; echo 10 &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &#39;kdc:renewal_lifetime&#39;; echo 168 You can see the Kerberos policies are all stored in their own keys in the Group Policy Cache (/var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb), and they are all stored in hours. On the SYSVOL, they are actually stored in hours, minutes, and days, respectively. The reason these are all stored in hours on the system is that the samba daemon expects these attributes in hours. If we check the contents of the GptTmpl.inf and do some conversion, we can confirm these are correct. [Kerberos Policy] MaxTicketAge = 10 MaxServiceAge = 600 MaxRenewAge = 7 &gt;&gt;&gt; from samba.gp.gp_sec_ext import mins_to_hours, days_to_hours &gt;&gt;&gt; MaxTicketAge = 10 &gt;&gt;&gt; MaxServiceAge = 600 &gt;&gt;&gt; MaxRenewAge = 7 &gt;&gt;&gt; mins_to_hours(MaxServiceAge) &#39;10&#39; &gt;&gt;&gt; days_to_hours(MaxRenewAge) &#39;168&#39; It also helps to know how these Kerberos policies map to the samba daemon settings. Kerberos.Policy Samba.Setting Conversion MaxTicketAge kdc:user_ticket_lifetime None MaxServiceAge kdc:service_ticket_lifetime Minutes to Hours MaxRenewAge kdc:renewal_lifetime Days to Hours While the Kerberos policies have been stored to the Group Policy Log as expected, let’s next verify that the Password policies have been applied using the following ldapsearch. &gt; ldapsearch -H ldap://lizardo.suse.de -x -W -D &quot;Administrator@lizardo.suse.de&quot; -b DC=lizardo,DC=suse,DC=de -s base minPwdAge maxPwdAge minPwdLength pwdProperties # lizardo.suse.de dn: DC=lizardo,DC=suse,DC=de maxPwdAge: -36288000000000 minPwdAge: -864000000000 minPwdLength: 7 pwdProperties: 1 We can confirm these were set correctly by checking the contents of the GptTmpl.inf, plus doing some type conversion. [System Access] MinimumPasswordAge = 1 MaximumPasswordAge = 42 MinimumPasswordLength = 7 PasswordComplexity = 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; from samba.gp.gp_sec_ext import days2rel_nttime &gt;&gt;&gt; MinimumPasswordAge = 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; MaximumPasswordAge = 42 &gt;&gt;&gt; MinimumPasswordLength = 7 &gt;&gt;&gt; PasswordComplexity = 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; days2rel_nttime(MaximumPasswordAge) &#39;-36288000000000&#39; &gt;&gt;&gt; days2rel_nttime(MinimumPasswordAge) &#39;-864000000000&#39; Finally, here is how these policies map.

Both Machine and User policy is supported. This policy does not upload a script for execution, it only schedules an existing script to run. To first load a script onto the client, see the Files Policy in chapter 8. This policy is physically stored on the SYSVOL in the MACHINE/Registry.pol and USER/Registry.pol files within the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. It is stored in registry format. See chapter 20 for details on how to manually modify this file. 6.1 Server Side Extension The Server Side Extension for smb.conf policies is distributed using Administrative Templates (ADMX). Refer to chapter 19.1 in section 19.1.1 for details about Administrative Templates. Setting up the ADMX templates for this policy is described in chapter 21 section 21.1. 6.1.1 Managing Machine Scripts Policies via the GPME As an example, let’s create a simple cron job which echo’s “hello world” once every day. Open the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME). For instructions on accessing the GPME, see chapter 3 section 3.1. In the left pane of the GPME, navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings &gt; Scripts. Scripts Server Side Extension (ADMX) In the right pane, double-click the “Daily” policy. In the “Daily” dialog box, click the Enabled option and then click the Show button. In the “Show Contents” dialog box, type the following script in the “Value” field: echo &quot;hello world&quot; Script Example Click OK to close the “Show Contents” dialog box, and then click OK again to close the “Daily” dialog box. 6.1.2 Managing User Scripts Policies via the GPME Next we’ll create a user script that echo’s the text “Don’t do that Dave” every hour. In the left pane of the GPME, navigate to User Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings &gt; Scripts. In the right pane, double-click the “Hourly” policy. In the “Hourly” dialog box, click the Enabled option and then click the Show button. In the “Show Contents” dialog box, type the following script in the “Value” field: echo &quot;Don&#39;t do that Dave&quot; User Script Example Click OK to close the “Show Contents” dialog box, and then click OK again to close the “Hourly” dialog box. The quote “Don’t do that Dave” is a line spoken by the character HAL 9000 in the science fiction film “2001: A Space Odyssey.” HAL is a sentient computer that controls the systems of a spacecraft, and the quote is spoken in a scene where HAL is attempting to prevent one of the astronauts from disconnecting its memory. 6.2 Client Side Extension The Scripts Client Side Extension (CSE) creates cron jobs on the Linux client. For Machine policy, these jobs are installed in a file within the /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.monthly, /etc/cron.weekly and /etc/cron.hourly directories. For User policy, the user’s crontab file is directly modified. In the previous section we created two test Script policies. If we now go to our Linux client, and check the Resultant Set of Policy, we see this: &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --rsop Resultant Set of Policy Computer Policy GPO: Default Domain Policy ================================================================= CSE: gp_scripts_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: Daily Scripts ----------------------------------------------------------- [ echo hello world ] ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- CSE: gp_centrify_crontab_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: Centrify/CrontabEntries ----------------------------------------------------------- [ @daily echo hello world from Centrify ] ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- ================================================================= &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --target=User -U tux --rsop Resultant Set of Policy User Policy GPO: Default Domain Policy ================================================================= CSE: gp_user_scripts_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: Hourly Scripts ----------------------------------------------------------- [ echo Don&#39;t do that Dave ] ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- CSE: gp_user_centrify_crontab_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: Centrify/CrontabEntries ----------------------------------------------------------- [ @hourly echo Don&#39;t do that Dave from Centrify ] ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- ================================================================= In addition to the expected scripts that we added previously, you’ll notice there are 2 additional entries. The gp_centrify_crontab_ext and gp_user_centrify_crontab_ext CSEs parse policies provided by a Centrify Server Side Extension. These weren’t introduced previously in the chapter because they are a proprietary solution not provided by Samba. Samba provides a CSE to apply these for compatability reasons, but does not provide a SSE to set them. These CSEs are provided to assist in migration from proprietary technologies. We won’t discuss these any further. Let’s now force an apply, and verify that the cron jobs are scheduled. &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --force &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &quot;TESTSYSDM$&quot; | sed -r &quot;s/\\\\\\22/\\&quot;/g&quot; | sed -r &quot;s/\\\\\\5C/\\\\\\\\/g&quot; | xmllint --format - &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; &lt;gp&gt; &lt;user name=&quot;TESTSYSDM$&quot;&gt; &lt;guid value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;&gt; &lt;gp_ext name=&quot;Unix Settings/Scripts&quot;&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings\\Daily Scripts:ZWNobyBoZWxsbyB3b3JsZA==&quot;&gt;/etc/cron.daily/gp_m94kdru9&lt;/attribute&gt; &lt;/gp_ext&gt; &lt;/guid&gt; &lt;applylog&gt; &lt;guid count=&quot;0&quot; value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;/&gt; &lt;/applylog&gt; &lt;/user&gt; &lt;/gp&gt; &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --target=User -U tux --force &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &quot;LIZARDO\\\\tux&quot; | sed -r &quot;s/\\\\\\22/\\&quot;/g&quot; | sed -r &quot;s/\\\\\\5C/\\\\\\\\/g&quot; | xmllint --format - &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; &lt;gp&gt; &lt;user name=&quot;LIZARDO\\tux&quot;&gt; &lt;guid value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;&gt; &lt;gp_ext name=&quot;Unix Settings/Scripts&quot;&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings\\Hourly Scripts:94d6cccd227ea60f662a2ea161560329df75d24b64265c405ba16209c715a0bb274b39b07d2c825dc926341839067d90a80d5570b2c68607b16915fd806de415&quot;&gt;@hourly echo Don&#39;t do that Dave&lt;/attribute&gt; &lt;/gp_ext&gt; &lt;/guid&gt; &lt;applylog&gt; &lt;guid count=&quot;0&quot; value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;/&gt; &lt;/applylog&gt; &lt;/user&gt; &lt;/gp&gt; First we see that the machine policy created the script /etc/cron.daily/gp_m94kdru9. Let’s take a look at the contents. &gt; sudo cat /etc/cron.daily/gp_m94kdru9 #!/bin/sh ### autogenerated by samba # # This file is generated by the gp_scripts_ext Group Policy # Client Side Extension. To modify the contents of this file, # modify the appropriate Group Policy objects which apply # to this machine.

The Startup Scripts Policy started as a compatability layer for Vintela’s Startup Scripts, but became the defacto standard for Samba also. This policy has no Server Side Extension in the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME), but only provides a samba-tool command for setting the policy. A nice advantage to using this policy is that when using the samba-tool gpo manage command to set the policy, it automatically uploads the script file you specify to the SYSVOL. This policy is physically stored on the SYSVOL in the MACHINE/VGP/VTLA/Unix/Scripts/Startup/manifest.xml file in the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. They are stored in an xml format, and are easily modified manually using a text editor. 7.1 Server Side Extension Startup Script Policies have no GPME Server Side Extension (SSE), so this policy may only be administered using samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup. This is because this SSE is stored on the SYSVOL as an xml file, not in the Registry.pol from an ADMX template. 7.1.1 Managing Startup Script Policies via samba-tool The Startup Scripts samba-tool command has 3 subcommands; add, list, and remove. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup &lt;subcommand&gt; Manage Startup Scripts Group Policy Objects Options: -h, --help show this help message and exit Available subcommands: add - Adds VGP Startup Script Group Policy to the sysvol list - List VGP Startup Script Group Policy from the sysvol remove - Removes VGP Startup Script Group Policy from the sysvol To add a new Startup Script policy to the SYSVOL, call the samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup add command. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup add --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup add &lt;gpo&gt; &lt;script&gt; [args] [run_as] [options] Adds VGP Startup Script Group Policy to the sysvol This command adds a startup script policy to the sysvol. Example: samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} test_script.sh &#39;\\-n \\-p all&#39; Options: --run-once Whether to run the script only once When adding a script, you pass the relative path to an existing script file. This script will be uploaded to the SYSVOL and made available to clients for execution. You can also provide an optional set of arguments that will be passed to the script when it is executed. These arguments are parsed as a single argument to the command, so they must be wrapped in quotes and all dashes (‘-’) must be escaped. There is also an optional argument run_as to instruct the client to run the script as a specific user. The optional --run-once parameter can instruct the script to execute only once, on the next startup, and not again. Let’s add a simple test script now which echos a message, and takes no arguments. By default this command will run as root. &gt; cat test_script.sh #!/bin/sh echo Something is happening here at startup &gt; samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} test_script.sh -UAdministrator &gt; samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup list {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} -UAdministrator @reboot root \\\\lizardo.suse.de\\Policies\\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\\MACHINE\\VGP\\VTLA\\Unix\\Scripts\\Startup\\test_script.sh Notice that the path to the script is now pointing to an uploaded copy on the SYSVOL.

This policy is also useful for deploying custom config files, etc. Like Startup Scripts, this policy began as a compatability layer for Vintela’s Files policy, but has become a Samba standard also. There is no Server Side Extension for the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME), but must be modified using the samba-tool gpo manage. This policy is physically stored on the SYSVOL in the MACHINE/VGP/VTLA/Unix/Files/manifest.xml file in the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. It is stored in an xml format, and is easily modified manually using a text editor. 8.1 Server Side Extension The Files Policy has no GPME Server Side Extension (SSE), so this policy may only be administered using samba-tool gpo manage files. This is because this SSE is stored on the SYSVOL as an xml file, not in the Registry.pol from an ADMX template. 8.1.1 Managing the Files Policy via samba-tool The Files samba-tool command has 3 subcommands; add, list, and remove. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage files --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage files &lt;subcommand&gt; Manage Files Group Policy Objects Options: -h, --help show this help message and exit Available subcommands: add - Add VGP Files Group Policy to the sysvol list - List VGP Files Group Policy from the sysvol remove - Remove VGP Files Group Policy from the sysvol To add a new File policy to the SYSVOL, call the samba-tool gpo manage files add command. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage files add --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage files add &lt;gpo&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;target&gt; &lt;user&gt; &lt;group&gt; &lt;mode&gt; [options] Add VGP Files Group Policy to the sysvol This command adds files which will be copied from the sysvol and applied to winbind clients. Example: samba-tool gpo manage files add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} ./source.txt /usr/share/doc/target.txt root root 600 The source argument refers to the source file on the host you are running the command from. This source file will be uploaded to the SYSVOL. The target argument is where the file should be deployed to on the client by the CSE. The user, group and mode refer to the attributes which will be assigned to the file when it is deployed to the client. If, for example, we were to create a daily script (as described in chapter 6), we could use this policy to deploy that script to the Linux client. Let’s now create a policy for testing that deployment. &gt; cat test_script.sh #!/bin/sh echo Something is happening daily &gt; samba-tool gpo manage files add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} ./test_script.sh /usr/bin/test_script.sh root root 555 -UAdministrator &gt; samba-tool gpo manage files list {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} -UAdministrator -r-xr-xr-x root root /usr/bin/test_script.sh -&gt; test_script.sh The output of the samba-tool gpo manage files list command now shows that we have a policy set which will deploy a link to our test_script.sh on the host.

Only Machine policy is supported. This policy could be useful in conjunction with the Files Policy found in chapter 8. This policy is physically stored on the SYSVOL in the MACHINE/VGP/VTLA/Unix/Symlink/manifest.xml file in the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. It is stored in an xml format, and is easily modified manually using a text editor. 9.1 Server Side Extension The Symlink Policy has no GPME Server Side Extension (SSE), so this policy may only be administered using samba-tool gpo manage symlink. This is because this SSE is stored on the SYSVOL as an xml file, not in the Registry.pol from an ADMX template. 9.1.1 Managing the Symlink Policy via samba-tool The Symlink samba-tool command has 3 subcommands; add, list, and remove. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage symlink --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage symlink &lt;subcommand&gt; Manage symlink Group Policy Objects Options: -h, --help show this help message and exit Available subcommands: add - Adds a VGP Symbolic Link Group Policy to the sysvol list - List VGP Symbolic Link Group Policy from the sysvol remove - Removes a VGP Symbolic Link Group Policy from the sysvol To add a new Symlink policy to the SYSVOL, call the samba-tool gpo manage symlink add command. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage symlink add --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage symlink add &lt;gpo&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;target&gt; [options] Adds a VGP Symbolic Link Group Policy to the sysvol This command adds a symlink setting to the sysvol that will be applied to winbind clients. Example: samba-tool gpo manage symlink add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} /tmp/source /tmp/target This command will add a policy instructing the client to create a symbolic link pointing to source named target. Let’s add a simple policy, which uploads a configuration file using the Files Policy (see chapter 8), then symlinks that configuration file to somewhere useful on the system. &gt; cat servlist.conf N=Libera.Chat L=1 E=UTF-8 (Unicode) F=23 D=0 S=irc.libera.chat/6697 J=#samba-technical &gt; samba-tool gpo manage files add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} servlist.conf /usr/share/servlist.conf &#39;LIZARDO\\tux&#39; &#39;LIZARDO\\domain users&#39; 600 -UAdministrator &gt; samba-tool gpo manage files list {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} -UAdministrator -rw------- LIZARDO\\tux LIZARDO\\domain users /usr/share/servlist.conf -&gt; servlist.conf &gt; samba-tool gpo manage symlink add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} /usr/share/servlist.conf /home/LIZARDO/tux/.config/hexchat/servlist.conf -UAdministrator &gt; samba-tool gpo manage symlink list {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} -UAdministrator ln -s /usr/share/servlist.conf /home/LIZARDO/tux/.config/hexchat/servlist.conf Here we are uploading a configuration file for hexchat, then symlinking it to a user’s profile. The samba-tool gpo manage symlink list command displays the link operations that will be performed on the client. Later when we choose to remove this policy, we will do so with the samba-tool gpo manage symlink remove command. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage symlink remove {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} /usr/share/servlist.conf /home/LIZARDO/tux/.config/hexchat/servlist.conf -UAdministrator 9.2 Client Side Extension The Symlink Client Side Extension (CSE) creates a symlink between the source and target.

Listing the target, we also see that the symlink now exists. If we output the contents of our symlink, we can see that it is indeed pointing to our configuration file that we uploaded to the SYSVOL earlier. &gt; sudo cat /home/LIZARDO/tux/.config/hexchat/servlist.conf N=Libera.Chat L=1 E=UTF-8 (Unicode) F=23 D=0 S=irc.libera.chat/6697 J=#samba-technical "],["sudoers.html", "10 Sudoers Policies 10.1 Server Side Extension 10.2 Client Side Extension", " 10 Sudoers Policies The purpose of the Sudoers Polices are to deploy sudo rules to a Linux client. Naturally, only Machine policy is supported. This policy is physically stored in two different locations on the SYSVOL, in MACHINE/Registry.pol and in MACHINE/VGP/VTLA/Sudo/SudoersConfiguration/manifest.xml. The manifest.xml is in xml format, and is easily modified manually using a text editor. The Registry.pol is in registry format. See chapter 20 for details on how to manually modify this file. 10.1 Server Side Extension The Server Side Extensions (SSE) for Sudoers policies are distributed via either Administrative Templates (see 19.1 in section 19.1.1) or via the command samba-tool gpo manage sudoers. Rules added via the GPME can be modified from samba-tool (as of Samba 4.18), but rules added via samba-tool gpo manage sudoers will not be visible in the GPME. 10.1.1 Managing Sudoers Policy via the GPME Setting up the ADMX templates for this policy is described in chapter 21 section 21.1. To add a new sudo rule using the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME): Open the Group Policy Management Editor. For instructions on accessing the GPME, see chapter 3 section 3.1. In the Group Policy Management Editor window, navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings. Group Policy Management Editor In the right pane, double-click on the “Sudo Rights” setting. In the “Sudo Rights” dialog box, click on the “Show” button next to “Sudoers commands”. In the “Show Contents” dialog box, enter a new sudo rule. Click “OK” to save the new sudo rule and close the dialog box. Adding a Sudo Rule After applying this rule, you can list the rule using samba-tool. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage sudoers list {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} -UAdministrator fakeu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL 10.1.2 Managing Sudoers Policy via samba-tool The Sudoers Policy can also be set via the samba-tool gpo manage sudoers command, which has 3 subcommands; add, list, and remove. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage sudoers --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage sudoers &lt;subcommand&gt; Manage Sudoers Group Policy Objects Options: -h, --help show this help message and exit Available subcommands: add - Adds a Samba Sudoers Group Policy to the sysvol list - List Samba Sudoers Group Policy from the sysvol remove - Removes a Samba Sudoers Group Policy from the sysvol To add a new Sudoers rule to the SYSVOL, call the samba-tool gpo manage sudoers add command. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage sudoers add --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage sudoers add &lt;gpo&gt; &lt;command&gt; &lt;user&gt; &lt;users&gt; [groups] [options] Adds a Samba Sudoers Group Policy to the sysvol This command adds a sudo rule to the sysvol for applying to winbind clients. The command argument indicates the final field in the sudo rule. The user argument indicates the user specified in the parentheses. The users and groups arguments are comma separated lists, which are combined to form the first field in the sudo rule. The --passwd argument specifies whether the sudo entry will require a password be specified. The default is False, meaning the NOPASSWD field will be specified in the sudo entry. Example: samba-tool gpo manage sudoers add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} ALL ALL fakeu fakeg The example command will generate the following sudoers entry: fakeu,fakeg% ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL Let’s add a simple rule for testing. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage sudoers add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} ALL ALL fakeu fakeg -UAdministrator &gt; samba-tool gpo manage sudoers list {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} -UAdministrator fakeu,fakeg% ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL fakeu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL You’ll notice that listing the entries now includes the entry we just created, as well as the one we added earlier using the GPME. 10.2 Client Side Extension Samba actually supplies 3 different Client Side Extensions (CSE) for the Sudoers policy. This is to support 3 different SSE providers. The first is Samba’s original policy, which is modified using the GPME as explained in section 10.1.1. The second is the Vintela compatible policy, which can be set using samba-tool as explained in section 10.1.2. The final CSE is the Centrify compatible policy, which is only provided as a convenience for migration. All these CSEs behave the same in how they apply policy (and share some of the same code). The preceeding instructions refer to all three CSEs. The Sudoer CSEs create a file within /etc/sudoers.d for each rule specified on the SYSVOL. Each rule is validated before installing, to ensure the system isn’t left in a broken state. Let’s list the Resultant Set of Policy to view the Sudoer rules we created in the previous sections. &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --rsop Resultant Set of Policy Computer Policy GPO: Default Domain Policy ================================================================= CSE: gp_sudoers_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: Sudo Rights ----------------------------------------------------------- [ fakeu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL ] ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- CSE: vgp_sudoers_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: VGP/Unix Settings/Sudo Rights ----------------------------------------------------------- [ fakeu,fakeg% ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL ] ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- CSE: gp_centrify_sudoers_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- ================================================================= Notice that both the rules we created earlier are listed, but under different CSEs. These policies will be applied by different CSEs because they are stored on the SYSVOL differently. The results will be similar though. Currently we don’t have any Centrify combatible policy in our environment, so this CSE remains empty. Let’s now force our policy to apply and see how the CSEs behave. &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --force &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &quot;TESTSYSDM$&quot; | sed -r &quot;s/\\\\\\22/\\&quot;/g&quot; | xmllint --format - &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; &lt;gp&gt; &lt;user name=&quot;TESTSYSDM$&quot;&gt; &lt;guid value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;&gt; &lt;gp_ext name=&quot;Unix Settings/Sudo Rights&quot;&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;ZmFrZXUgQUxMPShBTEwpIE5PUEFTU1dEOiBBTEw=&quot;&gt;/etc/sudoers.d/gp_mzarfh6k&lt;/attribute&gt; &lt;/gp_ext&gt; &lt;gp_ext name=&quot;VGP/Unix Settings/Sudo Rights&quot;&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;ZmFrZXUsZmFrZWclIEFMTD0oQUxMKSBOT1BBU1NXRDogQUxM&quot;&gt;/etc/sudoers.d/gp_qy2eo07y&lt;/attribute&gt; &lt;/gp_ext&gt; &lt;/guid&gt; &lt;applylog&gt; &lt;guid count=&quot;0&quot; value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;/&gt; &lt;/applylog&gt; &lt;/user&gt; &lt;/gp&gt; We can see the Sudoer rules have been applied to /etc/sudoers.d/gp_mzarfh6k and /etc/sudoers.d/gp_qy2eo07y. &gt; sudo cat /etc/sudoers.d/gp_mzarfh6k ### autogenerated by samba # # This file is generated by the gp_sudoers_ext Group Policy # Client Side Extension.

This policy is physically stored in three different locations on the SYSVOL, in MACHINE/Registry.pol, MACHINE/VGP/VTLA/Unix/Issue/manifest.xml, and MACHINE/VGP/VTLA/Unix/MOTD/manifest.xml. The manifest.xml files are in xml format, and are easily modified manually using a text editor. The Registry.pol is in registry format. See chapter 20 for details on how to manually modify this file. 11.1 Server Side Extension The Server Side Extensions (SSE) for Message policies are distributed via either Administrative Templates (see chapter 19.1 in section 19.1.1) or via the commands samba-tool gpo manage motd and samba-tool gpo manage issue. Rules added via GPME will not be visible to the respective samba-tool commands, and vice versa. This is because the samba-tool commands are intended to manage Vintela Group Policy compatability. These two SSEs should not be used in conjunction to one another, as it will cause unpredicatable results on the client. 11.1.1 Managing Message Policy via the GPME Setting up the ADMX templates for this policy is described in chapter 21 section 21.1.

The Samba policy distributed via the GPME discussed in 11.1.1 called gp_msgs_ext, and the Vintela compatible policy split in 2 parts discussed in 11.1.2 called vgp_motd_ext and vgp_issue_ext. These CSEs set the contents of /etc/motd and /etc/issue. If both Samba and Vintela compatible policies are set, they will conflict.

Example: samba-tool gpo manage access add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} allow goodguy example.com Let’s add a few rules that restricts access to a couple of specific users. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage access add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} allow Administrator lizardo.suse.de -UAdministrator &gt; samba-tool gpo manage access add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} allow tux lizardo.suse.de -UAdministrator These grant access to the users tux and Administrator on the host. If we list our access policies, we can see they are ready for delivery to the client. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage access list {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} -UAdministrator +:lizardo.suse.de\\Administrator:ALL +:lizardo.suse.de\\tux:ALL 12.2 Client Side Extension The PAM Access Client Side Extension (CSE) will create a new file in the /etc/security/access.d directory for each host access rule. The PAM module pam_access must be configured or this CSE will do nothing (see man pam_access). This can be configured using the command pam-config --add --access. It may be beneficial to ensure this is enabled by enforcing a Script policy which executes pam-config --add --access (see chapter 6 on how to schedule a script policy).

To modify the contents of this file, # modify the appropriate Group Policy objects which apply # to this machine. DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE DIRECTLY. # -:ALL:ALL The PAM Access CSE automatically added a deny all entry. The pam_access pam module reads host access rules in numerical order from the /etc/security/access.d directory. This automatic deny all entry was intentionally placed numerically after our allow entries (9000000001 &gt; 0000000001), to ensure the allow entries are processed first. You should notice at this point that it would be senseless to intermix allow and deny rules. Any time an allow rule is applied to a client, deny all else is implicitly assumed. It doesn’t hurt to have extra deny rules, but they would be pointless. When only deny rules are set in the policy, then allow all else is implicitly assumed (which is the pam default, and no extra rules are added). You can safely stack group policies which contain different allow rules, since the deny all else entries will always be placed in a range above the host access rules. You will see multiple deny all else entries generated, and this is intentional. This ensures there is always a deny all else entry associated with any allow rules which are applied. "],["certautoenroll.html", "13 Certificate Auto Enrollment Policy 13.1 Server Side Extension 13.2 Client Side Extension", " 13 Certificate Auto Enrollment Policy Certificate Auto Enrollment allows devices to enroll for certificates from Active Directory Certificate Services. Samba’s Certificate Auto Enrollment uses the certmonger service to keep track of certificates. It also uses the cepces plugin to certmonger. 13.1 Server Side Extension The Server Side Extension (SSE) for Certificate Auto Enrollment is part of the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME). Currently, no samba-tool command is available for managing this policy. The policy requires access to a Windows certificate server. On the certificate server, the roles Certification Authority, Certificate Enrollment Policy Web Service, and Certificate Enrollment Web Service all must be installed and configured. Optionally the role Network Device Enrollment Service can be installed to simplify the fetching of the root certificate chain by the client. Configuring the certificate server is beyond the scope of this book. Optionally, the Network Device Enrollment role can be configured on the server, which will allow the client to fetch the root certificate chain. Without this role, the Client Side Extension will report the following warnings: [W26775]| Failed to fetch the root certificate chain. | {} [W05621]| The Network Device Enrollment Service is either not installed or not configured. | {} [W11946]| Installing the server certificate only. | {} 13.1.1 Managing Certificate Auto Enrollment via the GPME To enable Certificate Auto Enrollment using the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME): Open the Group Policy Management Editor. For instructions on accessing the GPME, see chapter 3 section 3.1. In the Group Policy Management Editor window, navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Public Key Policies. Public Key Policies Double click on and open the Certificate Services Client - Auto-Enrollment properties. Certificate Services Client - Auto-Enrollment In the properties dialog, set the Configuration Model to “Enabled” and check the boxes to enable Renew expired certificates, update pending certificates, and remove revoked certificates and Update certificates that use certificate templates. Enable Certificate Auto-Enrollment Click “Apply” to apply the changes and “OK” to close the properties dialog. This has enabled simple Certificate Auto Enrollment. Next lets configure advanced Certificate Auto Enrollment. Advanced Certificate Auto Enrollment allows you to add multiple certificate servers to your configuration. This is useful in a more complex environment with multiple certificate servers, but is not necessary in a simple environment with a single certificate server. The advanced configuration stores the policy directly on the SYSVOL in the Registry.pol file, whereas a simple configuration is stored in LDAP. To configure Advanced Certificate Auto Enrollment: In the Group Policy Management Editor window, navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Public Key Policies. Double-click on “Certificate Services Client - Certificate Enrollment Policy” to open its properties. Certificate Services Client - Certificate Enrollment Policy Set the Configuration Model to Enabled. The default policy (configured previously in the “Certificate Services Client - Auto-Enrollment” properties) should already be listed under “Certificate enrollment policy list.” You can disable this policy if desired by unchecking the box next to the item in the list. Certificate Services Client - Certificate Enrollment Policy: Enabled To add additional certificate servers for Certificate Auto Enrollment, click “Add…” Add a Certificate Enrollment Policy Server In the Certificate Enrollment Policy Server dialog, enter the enrollment policy server URI and set the authentication type. “Windows integrated” authentication refers to Kerberos authentication. You can set a priority for the policy, which determines the order in which the policy is applied to a client machine. When finished, click “Add” and then “Apply” in the properties dialog. Click “OK” to close the dialog. 13.1.2 Certificate Templates Certificate Templates instruct the client how to generate a certificate request for the Certificate Authority. These templates are configured using the Certification Authority utility included with the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) found in Windows. To create a certificate template: Open the Certification Authority utility, and click on Certificate Templates in the tree. Certification Authority utility Right click on Certificates Templates in the tree and select Manage. You’ll notice that there are a number of existing templates to choose from. Right click on one of the templates in the list, and click Duplicate Template. Certificate Templates Console Switch to the General tab, and set a name for your new template. Set the number of years the certificate will be valid and the renewal period. Template Properties It may be useful to also review the Cryptography tab and ensure the cryptographic requirements for the certificate will meet the needs of your organization. Apply and close the properties by clicking OK. Close the Certificate Templates Console Next, to enable the new template, right click on Certificate Templates in the tree within the Certification Authority utility, and click New &gt; Certificate Template to Issue. In the Enable Certificate Templates dialog, select the template we just created, and click OK. Enable Certificate Templates Our new template is now enabled, and should be in the list of enabled templates in the Certification Authority utility. Template Enabled 13.2 Client Side Extension The Certificate Auto Enrollment Client Side Extension (CSE) will add new Certificate Authorities to certmonger, and automatically request to track new certificates based on the assigned Certificate Templates. This CSE requires that the certmonger and cepces packages be installed. Certificates will be installed in /var/lib/samba/certs and private keys in /var/lib/samba/private/certs by default. It may be necessary to configure a symlink policy, as explained in chapter 9, in order to link to a more appropriate location for these files.

This is the system trust store. In addition to linking our CA root certificate to the trust store, the CSE also called the update-ca-certificates command to refresh the certificate store. Take a look at man update-ca-certificates for more details on how this works. Now that we see our certificates have been installed, lets take a look at certmonger to see our CA and make sure our certificates are being auto-renewed. &gt; sudo getcert list-cas CA &#39;lizardo-WIN-QLIPDP2ISN7-CA&#39;: is-default: no ca-type: EXTERNAL helper-location: /usr/libexec/certmonger/cepces-submit --server=WIN-QLIPDP2ISN7.lizardo.suse.de --auth=Kerberos &gt; sudo getcert list Number of certificates and requests being tracked: 2.

The status on your certificates should say MONITORING, as it does here. If not, then you’ll need to do some investigation to see why. 13.2.1 Trouble Shooting Certificates If your certificates are not listed with a MONITORING status in getcert list, then you can start trouble shooting by rerunning sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --force. Look for any errors in the output that could indicate what caused the problem. For example, a common error you’ll encounter is Failed to fetch the list of supported templates. This error comes with a detailed backtrace. Look for the Caused by message. 13.2.1.1 Certificate doesn’t match This particular error happens when Internet Information Services (IIS) has the wrong root certificate selected. (Caused by SSLError(CertificateError(&quot;hostname \\&#39;win-qlipdp2isn7.lizardo.suse.de\\&#39; doesn\\&#39;t match \\&#39;lizardo-WIN-QLIPDP2ISN7-CA\\&#39;&quot;))) To resolve this error, open the IIS Manager, select the Default Web Site in the tree, then click Bindings in the right side Actions pane. IIS Manager Highlight the https binding, then select Edit.... Select the correct SSL certificate, then click OK to save. Edit Site Binding 13.2.1.2 python-requests security level Another error you may enounter is actually specific to the python-requests module. (Caused by SSLError(SSLError(1, &#39;[SSL: DH_KEY_TOO_SMALL] dh key too small (_ssl.c:852)&#39;),)) This DH_KEY_TOO_SMALL error is caused by a default security level change in python-requests. You can work around this error by setting openssl_seclevel=1 in the global section of your cepces.conf. 13.2.1.3 Checking request failures If the CA failed to issue a certificate when the template request was sent, we can check the Certification Authority utility to see why a request was rejected. If you click in the tree, there are lists of Failed Requests, Pending Requests, Issued Certificates, and Revoked Certificates. If your request failed for some reason, it may show up under Failed Requests, for example. Issued Certificates You can see, for example, in the Issued Certificates list, that the certificates we are monitoring on our test machine are listed here (the two most recent requests). 13.2.1.4 Examining logs Check the logs to track down other issues. The cepces plugin logs to /var/log/cepces/cepces.log by default. Check the handler_fileHandler section of /etc/cepces/logging.conf for the exact location of the log. Additionally, some errors may end up in the certmonger logs, instead of cepces. You can check journalctl -xe -t certmonger for certmonger messages.

Zones are defined as a list in the Zones setting in the Firewalld policy. Existing zones on the host will be unaffected. Rules are defined using a JSON dictionary, containing zones paired with a list of rules. For example, to create rules for the Work and Home zones, specify the following JSON: { &quot;work&quot;: [ {&quot;rule&quot;: {&quot;family&quot;: &quot;ipv4&quot;}, &quot;source address&quot;: &quot;172.25.1.7&quot;, &quot;service name&quot;: &quot;ftp&quot;, &quot;reject&quot;: {}}, {&quot;rule&quot;: {}, &quot;source address&quot;: &quot;172.25.1.8&quot;, &quot;service name&quot;: &quot;ftp&quot;, &quot;reject&quot;: {}} ], &quot;home&quot;: [ {&quot;rule&quot;: {}, &quot;protocol value&quot;: &quot;icmp&quot;, &quot;reject&quot;: {}}, {&quot;rule&quot;: {&quot;family&quot;: &quot;ipv4&quot;}, &quot;source address&quot;: &quot;192.168.1.2/32&quot;, &quot;service name&quot;: &quot;telnet&quot;, &quot;accept&quot;: {&quot;limit value&quot;: &quot;1/m&quot;}} ] } The rule structure loosely follows the Firewalld Rich Language Documentation.

"],["writing-group-policy-extensions.html", "19 Writing Group Policy Extensions 19.1 Creating the Server Side Extension 19.2 Creating the Client Side Extension", " 19 Writing Group Policy Extensions The chapter will explain how to write a Group Policy Extension for Samba’s Winbind. Group Policy is a delivery mechanism for distributing system settings and company policies to machines joined to an Active Directory domain. Unix/Linux machines running Samba’s Winbind can also deploy these policies. 19.1 Creating the Server Side Extension 19.1.1 Administrative Templates The first step to deploying Group Policy is to create a Server Side Extension (SSE). There are multiple ways to create an SSE, but here we’ll only discuss Administrative Templates (ADMX). The purpose of the SSE is to deploy policies to the SYSVOL share. Theoretically, you could manually deploy any file (even plain text) to the SYSVOL and then write a Client Side Extension that parses it, but ADMX can be read and modified by the Group Policy Management Editor, which makes administration of policies simpler. ADMX files are simply XML files which explain to the Group Policy Management Console how to display and store a policy in the SYSVOL. AMDX files always store policies in Registry.pol files. Samba provides a mechanism for parsing these, which we’ll discuss later. Below is a simple example of an ADMX template, and it’s corresponding ADML file. samba.admx: &lt;policyDefinitions revision=&quot;1.0&quot; schemaVersion=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt; &lt;policyNamespaces&gt; &lt;target prefix=&quot;fullarmor&quot; namespace=&quot;FullArmor.Policies.98BB16AF_01EE_4D17_870D_A3311A44D6C2&quot; /&gt; &lt;using prefix=&quot;windows&quot; namespace=&quot;Microsoft.Policies.Windows&quot; /&gt; &lt;/policyNamespaces&gt; &lt;supersededAdm fileName=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;resources minRequiredRevision=&quot;1.0&quot; /&gt; &lt;categories&gt; &lt;category name=&quot;CAT_3338C1DD_8A00_4273_8547_158D8B8C19E9&quot; displayName=&quot;$(string.CAT_3338C1DD_8A00_4273_8547_158D8 B8C19E9)&quot; /&gt; &lt;category name=&quot;CAT_7D8D7DC8_5A9D_4BE1_8227_F09CDD5AFFC6&quot; displayName=&quot;$(string.CAT_7D8D7DC8_5A9D_4BE1_8227_F09CD D5AFFC6)&quot;&gt; &lt;parentCategory ref=&quot;CAT_3338C1DD_8A00_4273_8547_158D8B8C19E9&quot; /&gt; &lt;/category&gt; &lt;/categories&gt; &lt;policies&gt; &lt;policy name=&quot;POL_9320E11F_AC80_4A7D_A5C8_1C0F3F727061&quot; class=&quot;Machine&quot; displayName=&quot;$(string.POL_9320E11F_AC80_4A7D_A5C8_1C0F3F727061)&quot; explainText=&quot;$(string.POL_9320E11F_AC80_4A7D_A5C8_1C0F3F727061_Help)&quot; presentation=&quot;$(presentation.POL_9320E11F_AC80_4A7D_A5C8_1C0F3F727061)&quot; key=&quot;Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings&quot;&gt; &lt;parentCategory ref=&quot;CAT_7D8D7DC8_5A9D_4BE1_8227_F09CDD5AFFC6&quot; /&gt; &lt;supportedOn ref=&quot;windows:SUPPORTED_WindowsVista&quot; /&gt; &lt;elements&gt; &lt;list id=&quot;LST_2E9A4684_3C0E_415B_8FD6_D4AF68BC8AC6&quot; key=&quot;Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings\\Daily Scripts&quot; valueName=&quot;Daily Scripts&quot; /&gt; &lt;/elements&gt; &lt;/policy&gt; &lt;/policies&gt; &lt;/policyDefinitions&gt; en-US/samba.adml: &lt;policyDefinitionResources revision=&quot;1.0&quot; schemaVersion=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt; &lt;displayName&gt; &lt;/displayName&gt; &lt;description&gt; &lt;/description&gt; &lt;resources&gt; &lt;stringTable&gt; &lt;string id=&quot;CAT_3338C1DD_8A00_4273_8547_158D8B8C19E9&quot;&gt;Samba&lt;/string&gt; &lt;string id=&quot;CAT_7D8D7DC8_5A9D_4BE1_8227_F09CDD5AFFC6&quot;&gt;Unix Settings&lt;/string&gt; &lt;string id=&quot;POL_9320E11F_AC80_4A7D_A5C8_1C0F3F727061&quot;&gt;Daily Scripts&lt;/string&gt; &lt;string id=&quot;POL_9320E11F_AC80_4A7D_A5C8_1C0F3F727061_Help&quot;&gt;This policy setting allows you to execute commands, either local or on remote storage, daily.&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/stringTable&gt; &lt;presentationTable&gt; &lt;presentation id=&quot;POL_9320E11F_AC80_4A7D_A5C8_1C0F3F727061&quot;&gt; &lt;listBox refId=&quot;LST_2E9A4684_3C0E_415B_8FD6_D4AF68BC8AC6&quot;&gt;Script and arguments&lt;/listBox&gt; &lt;/presentation&gt; &lt;/presentationTable&gt; &lt;/resources&gt; &lt;/policyDefinitionResources&gt; The meaning of the various tags are explained in Microsoft’s Group Policy documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/admx-schema.

Give your template a name, and click OK. Right click on the new template in the left tree view, and click New Category. Give the Category a name. This name will be displayed in the Group Policy Management Editor under Administrative Templates. You can choose to nest template under an existing category, or simply add it as a new root. Note: You can also add sub-categories under this category. After clicking OK, right click the category you created and select New Category. Next, create your policy by right clicking on your new category, and selecting New Policy Setting. Because we’ll be applying these settings to a Linux machine, the Registry fields are mostly meaningless, but they are required. Your policies will be stored under these keys on the SYSVOL in the Registry.pol file. Choose some sensible Registry Key, such as ‘Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings’, and a Registry Value Name, such as ‘Daily Scripts’ (these are the values used for Samba’s cron.daily policy). The Display Name is the name that will be displayed for this policy in the Group Policy Management Editor. I usually make this the same as the Registry Value Name, but it doesn’t need to be. Select whether this policy will be applied to a Machine, a User, or to Both in the Class field. In our example, we could potentially set Both, then our Client Side Extension would need to handle both cron.daily scripts (the Machine) and also User crontab entries. Click OK for your policy to be created. Your new policy will appear in the middle list view. Highlight it, and you will see a number of tabs below for configuring the policy. Select the Values tab and set the Enabled Value Type. In this case, we’ll use String, since our cron commands will be saved to the Registry.pol as a string. In the Value field, you can set a default enabled value (this is optional). Select the Presentation tab, right click in the Elements view, and click New Element &gt; ListBox (or a different presentation, depending on the policy). If you look at the samba.adml file from the previous section, you’ll notice that the presentationTable contains a listBox item. That’s what we’re creating here. Choose an element Label, this will be the name for the list displayed in the Group Policy Management Editor. Choose a Registry Key. This will be pre-populated with the parent Registry Key you gave when creating the policy. Append something to the key to make it unique. We’ll use ‘Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings\\Daily Scripts’ for our cron.daily policy. Navigate to the Explain tab, and add an explanation of what this policy is and what it does. This will be displayed to users in the Group Policy Management Editor. Now right click on your template name in the left tree, and select Save As. Finally, you’ll need to deploy your new policy definition to the SYSVOL. It should be saved to the Policies\\PolicyDefinitions (the Group Policy Central Store) directory. These instructions from Microsoft can assist you in setting up your Group Policy Central Store. 19.1.2 samba-tool gpo manage 19.2 Creating the Client Side Extension The Client Side Extension (CSE) is the code that will be called by Samba’s Winbind to deploy our newly created policy to a client machine. CSEs must be written in Python3, and are deployed using the register_gp_extension() and unregister_gp_extension() samba functions. #!/usr/bin/python3 # gp_scripts_ext samba gpo policy # Copyright (C) David Mulder &lt;dmulder@suse.com&gt; 2020 # # This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify # it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by # the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or # (at your option) any later version. # # This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, # but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of # MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The gp_pol_ext is a subclass of gp_ext that provides simplified parsing of Registry.pol files. If you choose to store your policies in ini/inf files in the SYSVOL (instead of using Administrative Templates), then you can inherit from the gp_inf_ext instead. If your class inherits from either gp_pol_ext or gp_inf_ext, it has a parse() function defined, which takes a single filename. The parse() function will parse the contents of the policy file and return it in a sensible format. If for some reason you choose to store data on the SYSVOL in some other format (such as in XML, etc), you’ll need to subclass gp_ext, then implement a read() function, like this: import xml.etree.ElementTree class gp_xml_ext(gp_ext): def read(self, data_file): return xml.etree.ElementTree.parse(data_file) The read() function is called by parse(), passing it a local filename tied to the systems SYSVOL cache. Then within process_group_policy() you can call parse() to fetch the parsed data from the SYSVOL. 19.2.2 Process Group Policy The process_group_policy() function serves two primary purposes; it applies new policy, and it removes old policy. In the example, you’ll notice there are two main loops. The first loop iterates over the deleted_gpo_list, which are all the policies that should be removed. The second loop iterates over the changed_gpo_list, which are new policies which must be applied. 19.2.3 Deleted GPOs for guid, settings in deleted_gpo_list: self.gp_db.set_guid(guid) if str(self) in settings: for attribute, script in settings[str(self)].items(): if os.path.exists(script): os.unlink(script) self.gp_db.delete(str(self), attribute) self.gp_db.commit() The deleted_gpo_list is a dictionary which contains the guids of Group Policy Objects, with associated settings which were previously applied. This list of applied settings is generated by the second loop (changed_gpo_list) while it is applying policy. The self.gp_db object is a database handle which allows you to manipulate the Group Policy Database. The Group Policy Database keeps track of all settings that have been applied, and info on how to revert those applied settings. For example, in the smb.conf CSE, the attribute stored in settings could be client max protocol and the stored value could be NT1. If our GPO has applied a client max protocol set to SMB3_11, the Group Policy database keeps track of the previous value of NT1 for when it’s time to remove the SMB3_11 policy. In our example cron script policy above, you can see that the stored value is a filename (the script variable). This is actually the name of the script we’ve applied, which will allow us to delete it later (therefore removing the policy). The scripts CSE is a special case, where we don’t need to keep track of an old value to restore, instead we’re keeping track of files to delete (since the ‘old value’ is that the script didn’t exist). 19.2.4 Changed GPOs for gpo in changed_gpo_list: if gpo.file_sys_path: reg_key = &#39;Software\\\\Policies\\\\Samba\\\\Unix Settings&#39; sections = { &#39;%s\\\\Daily Scripts&#39; % reg_key : &#39;/etc/cron.daily&#39;, &#39;%s\\\\Monthly Scripts&#39; % reg_key : &#39;/etc/cron.monthly&#39;, &#39;%s\\\\Weekly Scripts&#39; % reg_key : &#39;/etc/cron.weekly&#39;, &#39;%s\\\\Hourly Scripts&#39; % reg_key : &#39;/etc/cron.hourly&#39; } self.gp_db.set_guid(gpo.name) pol_file = &#39;MACHINE/Registry.pol&#39; path = os.path.join(gpo.file_sys_path, pol_file) pol_conf = self.parse(path) if not pol_conf: continue for e in pol_conf.entries: if e.keyname in sections.keys() and e.data.strip(): cron_dir = sections[e.keyname] attribute = &#39;%s:%s&#39; % (e.keyname, b64encode(e.data.encode()).decode()) old_val = self.gp_db.retrieve(str(self), attribute) if not old_val: with NamedTemporaryFile(prefix=&#39;gp_&#39;, mode=&quot;w+&quot;, delete=False, dir=cron_dir) as f: contents = &#39;#!/bin/sh\\n%s&#39; % intro contents += &#39;%s\\n&#39; % e.data f.write(contents) os.chmod(f.name, 0o700) self.gp_db.store(str(self), attribute, f.name) self.gp_db.commit() The second loop is a little more involved. When we iterate over changed_gpo_list, we’re actually iterating over a list of GPO objects. The attributes of the object are: gpo.name: The GUID of the GPO. gpo.file_sys_path: A physical path to a cache of GPO on the local filesystem. There are other methods and attributes, but these are the only ones important to a CSE. The primary purpose of this loop is to iterate over the GPOs, read their policy in the SYSVOL, then check the sections for the Registry Key we created in our Server Side Extension. If our policy Registry Key exists, then we read the entry and apply the policy. In our example, we find the ‘Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings\\Daily Scripts’ policy, then read the script contents from Registry.pol entry and write the script to a local file. In the example code, we write the script to a temporary file, then move the file to it’s permanent location in /etc/cron.daily. We also have to make sure we set the name of the new script in our self.gp_db (Group Policy Database). This ensures that we can remove the policy when we delete the GPO. At the beginning of our loop, we also need to ensure we call set_guid() on our Group Policy Database, so it knows which GPO we’re operating on. 19.2.5 Resultant Set of Policy The rsop() function in the extension is optional. It should return a dictionary containing key/value pairs of what our current policy will or has applied. The function is passed a list of GPO objects (similar to our changed_gpo_list), and we should parse the list similar to how we did in our changed_gpo_list loop. The difference is that the rsop() function does not apply any policy. It only returns what will be applied. This function enables the samba-gpupdate --rsop command to report on applied, or soon to be applied policy. 19.2.6 Registering/Unregistering a Client Side Extension The final step is to register an extension on the host. While the example code provides a detailed example of how to register an extension, the basic requirement is simply to call register_gp_extension(). ext_guid = &#39;{5930022C-94FF-4ED5-A403-CFB4549DB6F0}&#39; ext_path = os.path.realpath(__file__) register_gp_extension(ext_guid, &#39;gp_scripts_ext&#39;, ext_path, smb_conf=&#39;/etc/samba/smb.conf&#39;, machine=True, user=False) The extension guid can be any random guid. It simply must be unique among all extensions that you register to the host. The extension path is literally just the path to the source file containing your CSE. You must pass your smb.conf file to the extension, so it knows where to store the list of registered extensions. You also must specify whether to apply this extension to the machine, or to individual users (or to both). Unregistering the extension is simple. You call the unregister_gp_extension() and pass it the unique guid you previously chose which represents this CSE.

These commands format the registry policies as json to simplify the process. For example, a policy which sets the Firefox homepage would like like so: [ { &quot;keyname&quot;: &quot;Software\\\\Policies\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Homepage&quot;, &quot;valuename&quot;: &quot;StartPage&quot;, &quot;class&quot;: &quot;MACHINE&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;REG_SZ&quot;, &quot;data&quot;: &quot;homepage&quot; }, { &quot;keyname&quot;: &quot;Software\\\\Policies\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Homepage&quot;, &quot;valuename&quot;: &quot;URL&quot;, &quot;class&quot;: &quot;MACHINE&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;REG_SZ&quot;, &quot;data&quot;: &quot;samba.org&quot; } ] To set this policy on a GPO, we either put it in a file, or pass it samba-tool gpo load in standard input. &gt; sudo samba-tool gpo load -UAdministrator --content=test.json 20.2 Scripting with python Samba provides python libraries for manipulating a Registry.pol on Linux. The following python code snippet demonstrates how to open one of these files. from samba.ndr import ndr_unpack from samba.dcerpc import preg raw = open(&#39;Registry.pol&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;).read() pol_conf = ndr_unpack(preg.file, raw) The parsed file contains a list of entries, which you can iterate over. Each entry contains a keyname, valuename, and data. for e in pol_conf.entries: print(e.keyname, e.valuename, e.data) Writing to the pol_conf can be tricky. If you write the length of the entries prior to writing the entries, it will actually cause memory corruption (this is a bug). So ensure you write to the entries, then to the length. You can create an entry using the preg import from samba.dcerpc. e = preg.entry() e.keyname = b&#39;Software\\\\Policies\\\\Samba\\\\smb_conf&#39; e.valuename = b&#39;apply group policies&#39; e.type = 4 # REG_DWORD, an integer e.data = 1 entries = list(pol_data.entries) entries.append(e) pol_data.entries = entries pol_data.num_entries = len(entries) # Ensure you set the new num_entries last The data type refers to Microsoft defined registry types: Registry.type.name Registry.type.value REG_NONE 0 REG_SZ 1 REG_EXPAND_SZ 2 REG_BINARY 3 REG_DWORD 4 REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN 5 REG_LINK 6 REG_MULTI_SZ 7 REG_RESOURCE_LIST 8 REG_QWORD 11 To write your changes back to the Registry.pol file, you’ll use the following: from samba.ndr import ndr_pack with open(&#39;Registry.pol&#39;, &#39;wb&#39;) as w: w.write(ndr_pack(pol_data)) "],["install-admx.html", "21 Installing Administrative Templates 21.1 Install Samba ADMX Templates 21.2 Installing Firefox ADMX Templates 21.3 Installing Chromium ADMX Templates 21.4 Installing Windows ADMX Templates", " 21 Installing Administrative Templates Administrative Templates allow you to define policies that can be administered from the Group Policy Management Editor.

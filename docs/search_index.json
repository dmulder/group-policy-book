The Group Policy offerings are made to be similar to what is offered by proprietary tools, such as Vintela’s and Centrify’s Group Policy. Group Policy provides centralized management and configuration of operating system, application, and user settings. Policies are delivered to clients by listing them in LDAP, under groupPolicyContainer objects. These objects provide the gPCFileSysPath attribute, which points to policy information stored on the domains SYSVOL share. 2.1 What’s the difference between Group Policy and a Group Policy Object? A Group Policy Object (GPO) is a collection of settings that apply to a set of machines or users in a group. You can think of Group Policy like a template for a work order, and a Group Policy Object like a filled out copy of that template. A GPO is a work order of instructions to follow. That work order will be distributed to every member of the group, and it’s up to each member to decide how it applies those instructions. A GPO is modified by a Server Side Extension, and it is applied for a group member by a Client Side Extension. 2.2 Server Side Extensions The purpose of a Server Side Extension (SSE) is to fill out a work order (a Group Policy Object). On Windows, this generally refers to some component of the Group Policy Management Editor. Group Policy Management Editor In Samba, this also includes the samba-tool gpo manage command. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage Usage: samba-tool gpo manage &lt;subcommand&gt; Manage Group Policy Objects Options: -h, --help show this help message and exit Available subcommands: access - Manage Host Access Group Policy Objects files - Manage Files Group Policy Objects issue - Manage Issue Group Policy Objects motd - Manage Message of the Day Group Policy Objects openssh - Manage OpenSSH Group Policy Objects scripts - Manage Scripts Group Policy Objects security - Manage Security Group Policy Objects smb_conf - Manage smb.conf Group Policy Objects sudoers - Manage Sudoers Group Policy Objects symlink - Manage symlink Group Policy Objects When working with Linux clients, using samba-tool gpo manage to fill out your GPO is generally the preferred method. 2.2.1 Enabling Group Policy Server Side Extensions on the Server In order to use the Samba Administrative Templates in the Group Policy Management Console, you’ll need to install them first, using the command sudo samba-tool gpo admxload -UAdministrator. The samba-tool gpo admxload command copies the Samba ADMX templates to the /Policies/PolicyDefinitions directory on the SYSVOL share. After installing the Samba ADMX templates, you MUST install Microsoft’s ADMX templates also, otherwise you will be unable to administer Windows domain members. To install Microsoft’s ADMX templates, use msiextract to extract the contents of the Administrative Templates msi: msiextract /path/to/microsoft/download/Administrative\\ Templates\\ \\(.admx\\)\\ for\\ Windows\\ 10\\ October\\ 2020\\ Update.msi Then upload the contents to the SYSVOL: samba-tool gpo admxload -U Administrator --admx-dir=/path/to/extracted/msi/Program\\ Files/Microsoft\\ Group\\ Policy/Windows\\ 10\\ October\\ 2020\\ Update\\ \\(20H2\\)/PolicyDefinitions/ 2.3 Client Side Extensions In Group Policy vernacular, a Client Side Extension (CSE) is an encapsulated module on a client machine intended to enforce a specific policy. The responsibility of the CSE is to install that policy on the client and ensure it is enforced. It’s also the responsibility of the CSE to remove the policy when disabled by the server. In Samba, a CSE looks like a single python file. Within that file, the CSE inherits from one of several base classes provided by Samba which provide settings from the server. This is discussed in more detail in chapter 19. 2.3.1 Enabling Group Policy Client Side Extensions on the Linux Client To enable Group Policy in Winbind, set the apply group policies global smb.conf option to Yes. You can even deploy this setting from Group Policy smb.conf options, then running the apply command manually the first time with sudo samba-gpupate --force. Policies are enforced at a random interval between 90 and 120 seconds. Policies can be manually enforced at any time on a Linux domain member using the samba-gpupdate --force command. Winbind will enforce both machine policy (as of Samba 4.14) and user policy (as of Samba 4.18). If the Linux client is joined using SSSD, you can instead enforce the policy using oddjob-gpupdate. The samba-gpupdate command from Samba must also be installed. 2.3.2 Resultant Set of Policy Each CSE is configured to return a Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP), which indicates what policies will apply to a machine before applying (or shows what policies are already applied). It’s a compiliation of the policies for that Machine or User. To see the RSoP, run the command sudo samba-gpupdate --rsop for Machine policy, or sudo samba-gpupdate --rsop --target=User -U&lt;username&gt; to see User policy. linux-h7xz:~ # samba-gpupdate --rsop Resultant Set of Policy Computer Policy GPO: Default Domain Policy ============================================================ CSE: gp_sec_ext ------------------------------ ------------------------------ CSE: gp_sec_ext ------------------------------ ------------------------------ CSE: gp_scripts_ext ------------------------------ ------------------------------ CSE: gp_sudoers_ext ------------------------------ Policy Type: Sudo Rights ------------------------------ [ tux ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL ] ------------------------------ ------------------------------ CSE: gp_smb_conf_ext ------------------------------ Policy Type: smb.conf ------------------------------ [ apply group policies ] = 1 [ client max protocol ] = SMB2_02 ------------------------------ ------------------------------ CSE: gp_msgs_ext ------------------------------ Policy Type: /etc/motd ------------------------------ This message is distributed by Samba! ------------------------------ Policy Type: /etc/issue ------------------------------ Samba Group Policy \\s \\r \\l ------------------------------ ------------------------------ ============================================================ 2.4 Policies Introduced in this Book This section will provide a brief overview of the policies that will be discussed in upcoming chapters. 2.4.1 smb.conf Policies These policies distribute smb.conf global options to the client. These are found in the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; smb.conf. This policy is unable to apply idmap policies. 2.4.2 Password and Kerberos Policies Password and Kerberos policies are found in the GPME under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; OS Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Account Policy. These policies are only applicable to Samba Active Directory Domain Controllers. 2.4.3 Script Policies Script policies create cron jobs on client machines which execute the specified commands. These are found in the GPME under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings &gt; Scripts. 2.4.3.1 Centrify Crontab Entries Samba provides an extension which adds compatibility with Centrify’s Crontab Entries Group Policy. If you are currently using Centrify Group Policy to distribute Crontab entry policies, these will automatically be applied by samba-gpupdate. 2.4.4 Startup Script Policies Startup script policies allow you to upload the script that will be executed to the SYSVOL, as well as scheduling the command to run at startup. These scripts can be set using the samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup command. 2.4.5 Files Policy The Files policy deploys files to client machines. These files are uploaded to the SYSVOL via the samba-tool gpo manage files command. 2.4.6 Symlink Policies The symlink policy creates symbolic links on client machines. This policy is set via the samba-tool gpo manage symlink command. This policy is compatible with Vintela’s Symlink Group Policy. 2.4.7 Sudoers Policies Sudoers policies add sudo rules to client machines. These policies can be managed in the GPME under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings &gt; Sudo Rights. 2.4.7.1 VGP Sudoers Policies Another Sudoers extension is available for compatibility with Vintela’s Sudoers Group Policy. The policy for this extension can be modified using the samba-tool gpo manage sudo command. 2.4.7.2 Centrify Sudoers Policies A third Sudoers extension is available to provide compatibility with Centrify’s Sudoers Group Policy. If you are currently using Centrify Group Policy to distribute Sudoers policies, these will automatically be applied by samba-gpupdate. Samba Sudoers, VGP Sudoers, and Centrify Sudoers policies can be safely used in conjunction with one another, since these policies are non-overlapping. 2.4.8 Message Policies Message policies set the contents of the /etc/motd and /etc/issue files on client machines. These policies can be managed in the GPME under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings &gt; Messages. 2.4.8.1 VGP Message Policies Other VGP Message extensions are available for compatibility with Vintela’s MOTD and Issue Group Policies. The policies for these extensions can be modified using the samba-tool gpo manage motd and samba-tool gpo manage issue commands. Beware that applying both the Samba and VGP message policies will cause unpredictable behavior, since both policies will apply and will overwrite one another. 2.4.9 PAM Access Policies PAM Access policies set access rules within /etc/security/access.d. These policies are set using the samba-tool gpo manage access command. This policy is compatible with Vintela’s Access Group Policy. 2.4.10 Certificate Auto Enrollment Certificate Auto Enrollment allows devices to enroll for certificates from Active Directory Certificate Services. Certificate Auto Enrollment is available in Samba 4.16 and above. 2.4.11 Firefox Policy Firefox policies can be administered using the Mozilla policy templates provided by Mozilla. 2.4.12 Chromium/Chrome Policy Chromium and Google Chrome policies can be administered using the Chrome policy templates provided by Google. 2.4.13 GNOME Settings GNOME Settings policies are found in the GPME under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; GNOME. These policies manage some GNOME user settings, as described in the GNOME system admin guide, such as the compose key, screen dimming, online account management, extensions, and the ability to disable printing, file saving, command line access, fingerprint logon, logout, user switching, and reparitioning. There is also a general method for disabling any specific GNOME lockdown value. 2.4.14 OpenSSH Policy OpenSSH policy applies settings to /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d. These policies can be set using the samba-tool gpo manage openssh command. These policies are compatible with Vintela’s OpenSSH Group Policy. 2.4.15 Firewalld Policy Firewalld policy applies firewall rules using the firewall-cmd command. These policies can be found in the GPME under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings &gt; Firewalld.

A Windows Active Directory Administrator should know that Group Policies are managed via the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC). Unfortunately there isn’t a similar tool for Samba Active Directory Administrators. The Samba project does provide the comprehensive samba-tool gpo command, which supplants much of the GPMC. There are instances where Samba’s Group Policy can only be managed via the GPMC, with no samba-tool gpo alternative. These cases will be highlighted in the text. 3.1 Creating a Group Policy Object The samba-tool gpo create command is used to create a Group Policy Object. &gt; samba-tool gpo create --help Usage: samba-tool gpo create &lt;displayname&gt; [options] Create an empty GPO. 3.2 Deleting a Group Policy Object &gt; samba-tool gpo del --help Usage: samba-tool gpo del &lt;gpo&gt; [options] Delete a GPO. 3.3 Group Policy Links &gt; samba-tool gpo setlink --help Usage: samba-tool gpo setlink &lt;container_dn&gt; &lt;gpo&gt; [options] Add or update a GPO link to a container. &gt; samba-tool gpo dellink --help Usage: samba-tool gpo dellink &lt;container_dn&gt; &lt;gpo&gt; [options] Delete GPO link from a container. 3.4 Listing a Group Policy &gt; samba-tool gpo list --help Usage: samba-tool gpo list &lt;username|machinename&gt; [options] List GPOs for an account. 3.5 Modifying a Group Policy The samba-tool gpo manage is used for modifying settings on a Group Policy Object. See the individual chapters for each subcommand explanation. samba-tool command Chapter samba-tool gpo manage smb_conf 4 samba-tool gpo manage security 5 samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup 7 samba-tool gpo manage files 8 samba-tool gpo manage symlink 9 samba-tool gpo manage sudoers 10 samba-tool gpo manage issue 11 samba-tool gpo manage motd 11 samba-tool gpo manage access 12 samba-tool gpo manage openssh 17 "],["smbconf.html", "4 smb.conf Policies 4.1 Server Side Extension 4.2 Client Side Extension", " 4 smb.conf Policies The purpose of the smb.conf policies is to be able to distribute smb.conf settings to Linux clients. This policy only supports a physical smb.conf file, and currently does not support smb.conf registry settings. These policies are physically stored on the SYSVOL in the MACHINE/Registry.pol file in the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. They are stored in registry format, and are difficult to modify manually. See chapter 21 for details on how to manually modify this file. 4.1 Server Side Extension The Server Side Extension for smb.conf policies is distributed using Administrative Templates (ADMX). Refer to chapter 20 in section 20.1 for details about Administrative Templates. Setting up the ADMX templates for this policy is described in chapter 22 section 22.1. 4.1.1 Managing smb.conf Policies via the GPME After successfully installing the ADMX templates, open the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) and navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; smb.conf. For instructions on accessing the GPME, see chapter 3 section 3.1. smb.conf Server Side Extension (ADMX) For this example, we’re going to enable the apply group policies setting. This setting instructs Winbind to execute the samba-gpupdate command on the Group Policy interval (every 90 to 120 minutes). There are many other settings available here, but notice that idmap policies are not. That’s because idmap policies modify the setting name (not just the value). apply group policies Setting Apply the policy change, and close the GPME. 4.1.2 Managing smb.conf Policies via samba-tool Setting an smb.conf Group Policy via samba-tool is arguably much simpler. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage smb_conf set --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage smb_conf set &lt;gpo&gt; &lt;setting&gt; &lt;value&gt; [options] Sets a Samba smb.conf Group Policy to the sysvol This command sets an smb.conf setting to the sysvol for applying to winbind clients. Not providing a value will unset the policy. Example: samba-tool gpo manage smb_conf set {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} &#39;apply gpo policies&#39; yes This command does not require the ADMX templates to be installed, and also does not suffer from the same limitation as the GPME for idmap policies. 4.2 Client Side Extension The smb.conf Client Side Extension (CSE) directly modifies the default smb.conf file. Any custom formatting or comments in the smb.conf file may be overwritten. The CSE will open your existing smb.conf file, read in the current settings, set the settings provided by the GPO, then write the file back to disk. This CSE will only write global smb.conf options. In the previous section, we enabled the apply group policies smb.conf option. If we now go to our Linux client, and check the Resultant Set of Policy, we see this: &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --rsop Resultant Set of Policy Computer Policy GPO: Default Domain Policy ================================================================= CSE: gp_smb_conf_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: smb.conf ----------------------------------------------------------- [ apply group policies ] = 1 ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- ================================================================= If we now force the policy, we’ll see our setting gets applied to the default smb.conf: &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --force &gt; diff -u /etc/samba/smb.conf.BAK /etc/samba/smb.conf --- /etc/samba/smb.conf.BAK +++ /etc/samba/smb.conf @@ -1,5 +1,6 @@ # Global parameters [global] + apply group policies = Yes kerberos method = secrets and keytab logon drive = P: logon home = \\\\%L\\%U\\.9xprofile If for whatever reason the policy did not apply, it is sometimes helpful to look at the Group Policy Cache, which keeps track of applied policies. &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &quot;TESTSYSDM$&quot; | sed -r &quot;s/\\\\\\22/\\&quot;/g&quot; | xmllint --format - &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; &lt;gp&gt; &lt;user name=&quot;TESTSYSDM$&quot;&gt; &lt;guid value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;&gt; &lt;gp_ext name=&quot;smb.conf&quot;&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;apply group policies&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/attribute&gt; &lt;/gp_ext&gt; &lt;/guid&gt; &lt;applylog&gt; &lt;guid count=&quot;0&quot; value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;/&gt; &lt;/applylog&gt; &lt;/user&gt; &lt;/gp&gt; Where TESTSYSDM$ is the system name. You can see in our case Samba has recorded applying the Group Policy Object with GUID {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} (this is the Default Domain Policy), and that it set apply group policies = yes in our smb.conf. "],["sec.html", "5 Password and Kerberos Policies 5.1 Server Side Extension 5.2 Client Side Extension", " 5 Password and Kerberos Policies The purpose of these policies is to enforce password complexity and kerberos rules on a Samba Active Directory Domain Controller (ADDC). When a Linux client is not an ADDC, these policies are disabled and ignored automatically. These policies are physically stored on the SYSVOL in the MACHINE/Microsoft/Windows NT/SecEdit/GptTmpl.inf file in the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. They are stored in ini format, and are easily modified manually using a text editor. 5.1 Server Side Extension The Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) contains a built in Server Side Extension for Password and Kerberos Policies. There is also a samba-tool command to modify these policies. 5.1.1 Managing Password and Kerberos Policies via the GPME Open the GPME and navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Account Policy. The following password policies are applicable to a Samba ADDC: Maximum password age Minimum password age Minimum password length Password must meet complexity requirements Password Policies The following Kerberos policies are applicable to a Samba ADDC: Maximum lifetime for service ticket Maximum lifetime for user ticket Maximum lifetime for user ticket renewal Kerberos Policies 5.1.2 Managing Password and Kerberos Policies via samba-tool The Password and Kerberos policies can also be set via samba-tool. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage security set --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage security set &lt;gpo&gt; &lt;setting&gt; &lt;value&gt; [options] Set Samba Security Group Policy to the sysvol This command sets a security setting to the sysvol for applying to winbind clients. Not providing a value will unset the policy. These settings only apply to the ADDC. Example: samba-tool gpo manage security set {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} MaxTicketAge 10 Possible policies: MaxTicketAge Maximum lifetime for user ticket Defined in hours MaxServiceAge Maximum lifetime for service ticket Defined in minutes MaxRenewAge Maximum lifetime for user ticket renewal Defined in minutes MinimumPasswordAge Minimum password age Defined in days MaximumPasswordAge Maximum password age Defined in days MinimumPasswordLength Minimum password length Defined in characters PasswordComplexity Password must meet complexity requirements 1 is Enabled, 0 is Disabled 5.2 Client Side Extension The Password and Kerberos policies are seperated into two Client Side Extensions (CSE), gp_access_ext and gp_krb_ext. The Password policies (internally known as System Access) apply password complexity rules directly to the ADDC SamDB in the applicable LDAP attributes. The Kerberos policies are stored in our Group Policy Cache, and are fetched directly by the samba daemon when it loads. In the previous section we saw that our Password and Kerberos policies were already initialized to some defaults. If we now go to our Linux client, and check the Resultant Set of Policy, we see this: &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --rsop Resultant Set of Policy Computer Policy GPO: Default Domain Policy ================================================================= CSE: gp_access_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: System Access ----------------------------------------------------------- [ MinimumPasswordAge ] = 1 [ MaximumPasswordAge ] = 42 [ MinimumPasswordLength ] = 7 [ PasswordComplexity ] = 1 ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- CSE: gp_krb_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: Kerberos Policy ----------------------------------------------------------- [ MaxTicketAge ] = 10 [ MaxRenewAge ] = 7 [ MaxServiceAge ] = 600 ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- ================================================================= Remember that these policies will only be listed if your Linux client is a Samba ADDC. Let’s now force a policy apply, and check that the settings have changed. &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --force &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &quot;TESTSYSDM$&quot; | sed -r &quot;s/\\\\\\22/\\&quot;/g&quot; | xmllint --format - &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; &lt;gp&gt; &lt;user name=&quot;TESTSYSDM$&quot;&gt; &lt;guid value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;&gt; &lt;gp_ext name=&quot;System Access&quot;&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;minPwdAge&quot;/&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;maxPwdAge&quot;/&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;minPwdLength&quot;/&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;pwdProperties&quot;/&gt; &lt;/gp_ext&gt; &lt;gp_ext name=&quot;Kerberos Policy&quot;&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;kdc:user_ticket_lifetime&quot;/&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;kdc:renewal_lifetime&quot;/&gt; &lt;attribute name=&quot;kdc:service_ticket_lifetime&quot;/&gt; &lt;/gp_ext&gt; &lt;/guid&gt; &lt;applylog&gt; &lt;guid count=&quot;0&quot; value=&quot;{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}&quot;/&gt; &lt;/applylog&gt; &lt;/user&gt; &lt;/gp&gt; &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &#39;kdc:user_ticket_lifetime&#39;; echo 10 &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &#39;kdc:service_ticket_lifetime&#39;; echo 10 &gt; sudo tdbdump /var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb -k &#39;kdc:renewal_lifetime&#39;; echo 168 You can see the Kerberos policies are all stored in their own keys in the Group Policy Cache (/var/lib/samba/gpo.tdb), and they are all stored in hours. On the SYSVOL, they are actually stored in hours, minutes, and days, respectively. The reason these are all stored in hours on the system is that the samba daemon expects these attributes in hours. If we check the contents of the GptTmpl.inf and do some conversion, we can confirm these are correct. [Kerberos Policy] MaxTicketAge = 10 MaxServiceAge = 600 MaxRenewAge = 7 &gt;&gt;&gt; from samba.gp.gp_sec_ext import mins_to_hours, days_to_hours &gt;&gt;&gt; MaxTicketAge = 10 &gt;&gt;&gt; MaxServiceAge = 600 &gt;&gt;&gt; MaxRenewAge = 7 &gt;&gt;&gt; mins_to_hours(MaxServiceAge) &#39;10&#39; &gt;&gt;&gt; days_to_hours(MaxRenewAge) &#39;168&#39; It also helps to know how these Kerberos policies map to the samba daemon settings. Kerberos Policy Samba Setting Conversion MaxTicketAge kdc:user_ticket_lifetime None MaxServiceAge kdc:service_ticket_lifetime Minutes to Hours MaxRenewAge kdc:renewal_lifetime Days to Hours While the Kerberos policies have been stored to the Group Policy Log as expected, let’s next verify that the Password policies have been applied using the following ldapsearch. &gt; ldapsearch -H ldap://lizardo.suse.de -x -W -D &quot;Administrator@lizardo.suse.de&quot; -b DC=lizardo,DC=suse,DC=de -s base minPwdAge maxPwdAge minPwdLength pwdProperties # lizardo.suse.de dn: DC=lizardo,DC=suse,DC=de maxPwdAge: -36288000000000 minPwdAge: -864000000000 minPwdLength: 7 pwdProperties: 1 We can confirm these were set correctly by checking the contents of the GptTmpl.inf, plus doing some type conversion.

Both Machine and User policy is supported. This policy does not upload a script for execution, it only schedules an existing script to run. To first load a script onto the client, see the Files Policy in chapter 8. This policy is physically stored on the SYSVOL in the MACHINE/Registry.pol and USER/Registry.pol files within the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. It is stored in registry format. See chapter 21 for details on how to manually modify this file. 6.1 Server Side Extension The Server Side Extension for smb.conf policies is distributed using Administrative Templates (ADMX). Refer to chapter 20 in section 20.1 for details about Administrative Templates. Setting up the ADMX templates for this policy is described in chapter 22 section 22.1. 6.1.1 Managing Machine Scripts Policies via the GPME Open the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) and navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings &gt; Scripts. For instructions on accessing the GPME, see chapter 3 section 3.1. Scripts Server Side Extension (ADMX) As an example, we’ll create a simple cron job which echo’s “hello world” once every day. Script Example 6.1.2 Managing User Scripts Policies via the GPME Next we’ll create a user script that echo’s the text “Don’t do that Dave” every hour. Open the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) and navigate to User Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings &gt; Scripts. User Script Example 6.2 Client Side Extension The Scripts Client Side Extension (CSE) creates cron jobs on the Linux client. For Machine policy, these jobs are installed in a file within the /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.monthly, /etc/cron.weekly and /etc/cron.hourly directories. For User policy, the user’s crontab file is directly modified. In the previous section we created two test Script policies.

The gp_centrify_crontab_ext and gp_user_centrify_crontab_ext CSEs parse policies provided by a Centrify Server Side Extension. These weren’t introduced previously in the chapter because they are a proprietary solution not provided by Samba. Samba provides a CSE to apply these for compatability reasons, but does not provide a SSE to set them. These CSEs are provided to assist in migration from proprietary technologies. We won’t discuss these any further.

The Startup Scripts Policy started as a compatability layer for Vintela’s Startup Scripts, but became the defacto standard for Samba also. This policy has no Server Side Extension in the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME), but only provides a samba-tool command for setting the policy. A nice advantage to using this policy is that when using the samba-tool gpo manage command to set the policy, it automatically uploads the script file you specify to the SYSVOL. This policy is physically stored on the SYSVOL in the MACHINE/VGP/VTLA/Unix/Scripts/Startup/manifest.xml file in the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. They are stored in an xml format, and are easily modified manually using a text editor. 7.1 Server Side Extension Startup Script Policies have no GPME Server Side Extension (SSE), so this policy may only be administered using samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup. This is because this SSE is stored on the SYSVOL as an xml file, not in the Registry.pol from an ADMX template. 7.1.1 Managing Startup Script Policies via samba-tool The Startup Scripts samba-tool command has 3 subcommands; add, list, and remove. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup &lt;subcommand&gt; Manage Startup Scripts Group Policy Objects Options: -h, --help show this help message and exit Available subcommands: add - Adds VGP Startup Script Group Policy to the sysvol list - List VGP Startup Script Group Policy from the sysvol remove - Removes VGP Startup Script Group Policy from the sysvol To add a new Startup Script policy to the SYSVOL, call the samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup add command. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup add --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup add &lt;gpo&gt; &lt;script&gt; [args] [run_as] [options] Adds VGP Startup Script Group Policy to the sysvol This command adds a startup script policy to the sysvol. Example: samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} test_script.sh &#39;\\-n \\-p all&#39; Options: --run-once Whether to run the script only once When adding a script, you pass the relative path to an existing script file. This script will be uploaded to the SYSVOL and made available to clients for execution. You can also provide an optional set of arguments that will be passed to the script when it is executed. These arguments are parsed as a single argument to the command, so they must be wrapped in quotes and all dashes (‘-’) must be escaped. There is also an optional argument run_as to instruct the client to run the script as a specific user. The optional --run-once parameter can instruct the script to execute only once, on the next startup, and not again. Let’s add a simple test script now which echos a message, and takes no arguments. By default this command will run as root. &gt; cat test_script.sh #!/bin/sh echo Something is happening here at startup &gt; samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} test_script.sh -UAdministrator &gt; samba-tool gpo manage scripts startup list {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} -UAdministrator @reboot root \\\\lizardo.suse.de\\Policies\\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\\MACHINE\\VGP\\VTLA\\Unix\\Scripts\\Startup\\test_script.sh Notice that the path to the script is now pointing to an uploaded copy on the SYSVOL.

This policy is also useful for deploying custom config files, etc. Like Startup Scripts, this policy began as a compatability layer for Vintela’s Files policy, but has become a Samba standard also. There is no Server Side Extension for the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME), but must be modified using the samba-tool gpo manage. This policy is physically stored on the SYSVOL in the MACHINE/VGP/VTLA/Unix/Files/manifest.xml file in the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. It is stored in an xml format, and is easily modified manually using a text editor. 8.1 Server Side Extension The Files Policy has no GPME Server Side Extension (SSE), so this policy may only be administered using samba-tool gpo manage files. This is because this SSE is stored on the SYSVOL as an xml file, not in the Registry.pol from an ADMX template. 8.1.1 Managing the Files Policy via samba-tool The Files samba-tool command has 3 subcommands; add, list, and remove. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage files --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage files &lt;subcommand&gt; Manage Files Group Policy Objects Options: -h, --help show this help message and exit Available subcommands: add - Add VGP Files Group Policy to the sysvol list - List VGP Files Group Policy from the sysvol remove - Remove VGP Files Group Policy from the sysvol To add a new File policy to the SYSVOL, call the samba-tool gpo manage files add command. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage files add --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage files add &lt;gpo&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;target&gt; &lt;user&gt; &lt;group&gt; &lt;mode&gt; [options] Add VGP Files Group Policy to the sysvol This command adds files which will be copied from the sysvol and applied to winbind clients. Example: samba-tool gpo manage files add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} ./source.txt /usr/share/doc/target.txt root root 600 The source argument refers to the source file on the host you are running the command from. This source file will be uploaded to the SYSVOL. The target argument is where the file should be deployed to on the client by the CSE. The user, group and mode refer to the attributes which will be assigned to the file when it is deployed to the client. If, for example, we were to create a daily script (as described in chapter 6), we could use this policy to deploy that script to the Linux client. Let’s now create a policy for testing that deployment. &gt; cat test_script.sh #!/bin/sh echo Something is happening daily &gt; samba-tool gpo manage files add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} ./test_script.sh /usr/bin/test_script.sh root root 555 -UAdministrator &gt; samba-tool gpo manage files list {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} -UAdministrator -r-xr-xr-x root root /usr/bin/test_script.sh -&gt; test_script.sh The output of the samba-tool gpo manage files list command now shows that we have a policy set which will deploy a link to our test_script.sh on the host.

Only Machine policy is supported. This policy could be useful in conjunction with the Files Policy found in chapter 8. This policy is physically stored on the SYSVOL in the MACHINE/VGP/VTLA/Unix/Symlink/manifest.xml file in the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. It is stored in an xml format, and is easily modified manually using a text editor. 9.1 Server Side Extension The Symlink Policy has no GPME Server Side Extension (SSE), so this policy may only be administered using samba-tool gpo manage symlink.

Naturally, only Machine policy is supported. This policy is physically stored in two different locations on the SYSVOL, in MACHINE/Registry.pol and in MACHINE/VGP/VTLA/Sudo/SudoersConfiguration/manifest.xml. The manifest.xml is in xml format, and is easily modified manually using a text editor. The Registry.pol is in registry format. See chapter 21 for details on how to manually modify this file. 10.1 Server Side Extension The Server Side Extensions (SSE) for Sudoers policies are distributed via either Administrative Templates (see 20 in section 20.1) or via the command samba-tool gpo manage sudoers. Rules added via the GPME can be modified from samba-tool (as of Samba 4.18), but rules added via samba-tool gpo manage sudoers will not be visible in the GPME. 10.1.1 Managing Sudoers Policy via the GPME Setting up the ADMX templates for this policy is described in chapter 22 section 22.1. Open the GPME and navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Samba &gt; Unix Settings. Group Policy Management Editor Open the Sudo Rights setting, and add a new sudo rule. Adding a Sudo Rule After applying this rule, you can list the rule using samba-tool. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage sudoers list {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} -UAdministrator fakeu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL 10.1.2 Managing Sudoers Policy via samba-tool The Sudoers Policy can also be set via the samba-tool gpo manage sudoers command, which has 3 subcommands; add, list, and remove. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage sudoers --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage sudoers &lt;subcommand&gt; Manage Sudoers Group Policy Objects Options: -h, --help show this help message and exit Available subcommands: add - Adds a Samba Sudoers Group Policy to the sysvol list - List Samba Sudoers Group Policy from the sysvol remove - Removes a Samba Sudoers Group Policy from the sysvol To add a new Sudoers rule to the SYSVOL, call the samba-tool gpo manage sudoers add command. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage sudoers add --help Usage: samba-tool gpo manage sudoers add &lt;gpo&gt; &lt;command&gt; &lt;user&gt; &lt;users&gt; [groups] [options] Adds a Samba Sudoers Group Policy to the sysvol This command adds a sudo rule to the sysvol for applying to winbind clients. The command argument indicates the final field in the sudo rule. The user argument indicates the user specified in the parentheses. The users and groups arguments are comma separated lists, which are combined to form the first field in the sudo rule. The --passwd argument specifies whether the sudo entry will require a password be specified. The default is False, meaning the NOPASSWD field will be specified in the sudo entry. Example: samba-tool gpo manage sudoers add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} ALL ALL fakeu fakeg The example command will generate the following sudoers entry: fakeu,fakeg% ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL Let’s add a simple rule for testing. &gt; samba-tool gpo manage sudoers add {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} ALL ALL fakeu fakeg -UAdministrator &gt; samba-tool gpo manage sudoers list {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} -UAdministrator fakeu,fakeg% ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL fakeu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL You’ll notice that listing the entries now includes the entry we just created, as well as the one we added earlier using the GPME. 10.2 Client Side Extension Samba actually supplies 3 different Client Side Extensions (CSE) for the Sudoers policy. This is to support 3 different SSE providers. The first is Samba’s original policy, which is modified using the GPME as explained in section 10.1.1. The second is the Vintela compatible policy, which can be set using samba-tool as explained in section 10.1.2. The final CSE is the Centrify compatible policy, which is only provided as a convenience for migration. All these CSEs behave the same in how they apply policy (and share some of the same code). The preceeding instructions refer to all three CSEs. The Sudoer CSEs create a file within /etc/sudoers.d for each rule specified on the SYSVOL. Each rule is validated before installing, to ensure the system isn’t left in a broken state. Let’s list the Resultant Set of Policy to view the Sudoer rules we created in the previous sections. &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --rsop Resultant Set of Policy Computer Policy GPO: Default Domain Policy ================================================================= CSE: gp_sudoers_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: Sudo Rights ----------------------------------------------------------- [ fakeu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL ] ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- CSE: vgp_sudoers_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: VGP/Unix Settings/Sudo Rights ----------------------------------------------------------- [ fakeu,fakeg% ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL ] ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- CSE: gp_centrify_sudoers_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- ================================================================= Notice that both the rules we created earlier are listed, but under different CSEs. These policies will be applied by different CSEs because they are stored on the SYSVOL differently. The results will be similar though.

The pam_access pam module reads host access rules in numerical order from the /etc/security/access.d directory. This automatic deny all entry was intentionally placed numerically after our allow entries (9000000001 &gt; 0000000001), to ensure the allow entries are processed first. You should notice at this point that it would be senseless to intermix allow and deny rules. Any time an allow rule is applied to a client, deny all else is implicitly assumed. It doesn’t hurt to have extra deny rules, but they would be pointless. When only deny rules are set in the policy, then allow all else is implicitly assumed (which is the pam default, and no extra rules are added). You can safely stack group policies which contain different allow rules, since the deny all else entries will always be placed in a range above the host access rules. You will see multiple deny all else entries generated, and this is intentional. This ensures there is always a deny all else entry associated with any allow rules which are applied.

Samba’s Certificate Auto Enrollment uses the certmonger service to keep track of certificates. It also uses the cepces plugin to certmonger. 13.1 Server Side Extension The Server Side Extension (SSE) for Certificate Auto Enrollment is part of the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME). Currently, no samba-tool command is available for managing this policy. The policy requires access to a Windows certificate server. On the certificate server, the roles Certification Authority, Certificate Enrollment Policy Web Service, and Certificate Enrollment Web Service all must be installed and configured. Optionally the role Network Device Enrollment Service can be installed to simplify the fetching of the root certificate chain by the client. Configuring the certificate server is beyond the scope of this book. Optionally, the Network Device Enrollment role can be configured on the server, which will allow the client to fetch the root certificate chain. Without this role, the Client Side Extension will report the following warnings: [W26775]| Failed to fetch the root certificate chain. | {} [W05621]| The Network Device Enrollment Service is either not installed or not configured. | {} [W11946]| Installing the server certificate only. | {} 13.1.1 Managing Certificate Auto Enrollment via the GPME Open the GPME and navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Public Key Policies. Public Key Policies Double click on and open the Certificate Services Client - Auto-Enrollment properties. Certificate Services Client - Auto-Enrollment Set the Configuration Model to Enabled, and check the boxes to enable Renew expired certificates, update pending certificates, and remove revoked certificates and Update certificates that use certificate templates. Enable Certificate Auto-Enrollment Apply the changes and click OK to close the properties dialog. This has enabled simple Certificate Auto Enrollment. Next lets configure advanced Certificate Auto Enrollment. Advanced Certificate Auto Enrollment allows you add additional certificate servers to your configuration. This is not mandatory in a simple environment with only one certificate server. The advanced configuration stores the policy directly on the SYSVOL in the Registry.pol file, whereas a simple configuration is stored in LDAP. Open the Certificate Services Client - Certificate Enrollment Policy properties dialog (also under Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Public Key Policies in the GPME). Certificate Services Client - Certificate Enrollment Policy Set the Configuration Model to Enabled. Certificate Services Client - Certificate Enrollment Policy: Enabled The default policy (configured previously in the Certificate Services Client - Auto-Enrollment properties dialog) is already listed under Certificate enrollment policy list. You can disable this policy if you choose, by unchecking the checkbox next to the item in the list. Click Add... to add additional certificate servers for Certificate Auto Enrollment to configure on the clients. Add a Certificate Enrollment Policy Server Fill in the enrollment policy server URI, and set the authentication type. Windows integrated authentication refers to Kerberos authentication. Setting a priority will effect the order in which the policy is applied to a client machine. When finished, click Add, then Apply in the properties dialog and OK to close. 13.1.2 Certificate Templates Certificate Templates instruct the client how to generate a certificate request for the Certificate Authority. These templates are configured using the Certification Authority utility included with the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) found in Windows.

You’ll notice that there are a number of existing templates to choose from. Right click on one of the templates in the list, and click Duplicate Template. Certificate Templates Console Switch to the General tab, and set a name for your new template. Set the number of years the certificate will be valid and the renewal period. Template Properties It may be useful to also review the Cryptography tab and ensure the cryptographic requirements for the certificate will meet the needs of your organization. Apply and close the properties by clicking OK. Close the Certificate Templates Console Next, to enable the new template, right click on Certificate Templates in the tree within the Certification Authority utility, and click New &gt; Certificate Template to Issue. In the Enable Certificate Templates dialog, select the template we just created, and click OK. Enable Certificate Templates Our new template is now enabled, and should be in the list of enabled templates in the Certification Authority utility. Template Enabled 13.2 Client Side Extension The Certificate Auto Enrollment Client Side Extension (CSE) will add new Certificate Authorities to certmonger, and automatically request to track new certificates based on the assigned Certificate Templates. This CSE requires that the certmonger and cepces packages be installed. Certificates will be installed in /var/lib/samba/certs and private keys in /var/lib/samba/private/certs by default. It may be necessary to configure a symlink policy, as explained in chapter 9, in order to link to a more appropriate location for these files. Let’s list the Resultant Set of Policy to view the Certificate Auto Enrollment policy we created in the previous sections. &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --rsop Resultant Set of Policy Computer Policy GPO: Default Domain Policy ================================================================= CSE: gp_cert_auto_enroll_ext ----------------------------------------------------------- Policy Type: Auto Enrollment Policy ----------------------------------------------------------- [ lizardo-WIN-QLIPDP2ISN7-CA ] = [ CA Certificate ] = -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- &lt;REDACTED&gt; -----END CERTIFICATE----- [ Auto Enrollment Server ] = WIN-QLIPDP2ISN7.lizardo.suse.de [ Templates ] = [ Machine ] [ TestComputerTemplate ] ----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- ================================================================= Notice that the new template we created in the previous section is listed under the templates.

This is the system trust store. In addition to linking our CA root certificate to the trust store, the CSE also called the update-ca-certificates command to refresh the certificate store. Take a look at man update-ca-certificates for more details on how this works. Now that we see our certificates have been installed, lets take a look at certmonger to see our CA and make sure our certificates are being auto-renewed. &gt; sudo getcert list-cas CA &#39;lizardo-WIN-QLIPDP2ISN7-CA&#39;: is-default: no ca-type: EXTERNAL helper-location: /usr/libexec/certmonger/cepces-submit --server=WIN-QLIPDP2ISN7.lizardo.suse.de --auth=Kerberos &gt; sudo getcert list Number of certificates and requests being tracked: 2.

The status on your certificates should say MONITORING, as it does here. If not, then you’ll need to do some investigation to see why. 13.2.1 Trouble Shooting Certificates If your certificates are not listed with a MONITORING status in getcert list, then you can start trouble shooting by rerunning sudo /usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --force. Look for any errors in the output that could indicate what caused the problem. For example, a common error you’ll encounter is Failed to fetch the list of supported templates. This error comes with a detailed backtrace. Look for the Caused by message. 13.2.1.1 Certificate doesn’t match This particular error happens when Internet Information Services (IIS) has the wrong root certificate selected. (Caused by SSLError(CertificateError(&quot;hostname \\&#39;win-qlipdp2isn7.lizardo.suse.de\\&#39; doesn\\&#39;t match \\&#39;lizardo-WIN-QLIPDP2ISN7-CA\\&#39;&quot;))) To resolve this error, open the IIS Manager, select the Default Web Site in the tree, then click Bindings in the right side Actions pane. IIS Manager Highlight the https binding, then select Edit.... Select the correct SSL certificate, then click OK to save. Edit Site Binding 13.2.1.2 python-requests security level Another error you may enounter is actually specific to the python-requests module. (Caused by SSLError(SSLError(1, &#39;[SSL: DH_KEY_TOO_SMALL] dh key too small (_ssl.c:852)&#39;),)) This DH_KEY_TOO_SMALL error is caused by a default security level change in python-requests. You can work around this error by setting openssl_seclevel=1 in the global section of your cepces.conf. 13.2.1.3 Checking request failures If the CA failed to issue a certificate when the template request was sent, we can check the Certification Authority utility to see why a request was rejected. If you click in the tree, there are lists of Failed Requests, Pending Requests, Issued Certificates, and Revoked Certificates. If your request failed for some reason, it may show up under Failed Requests, for example. Issued Certificates You can see, for example, in the Issued Certificates list, that the certificates we are monitoring on our test machine are listed here (the two most recent requests). 13.2.1.4 Examining logs Check the logs to track down other issues. The cepces plugin logs to /var/log/cepces/cepces.log by default. Check the handler_fileHandler section of /etc/cepces/logging.conf for the exact location of the log. Additionally, some errors may end up in the certmonger logs, instead of cepces. You can check journalctl -xe -t certmonger for certmonger messages.

Mozilla Administrative Templates There are many options to choose from, but for this example we’ll just test setting a homepage. Click on Home page in the tree, and we’re going to modify both the Start Page and the URL for Home page. Start Page First we’ll set the Start Page to Homepage (Locked). This requires the start page to always open the homepage, and the user will be unable to change it to point anywhere else. Home Page Next we’ll set the homepage URL, and check the box Don't allow the homepage to be changed. This will prevent the user from changing the homepage. Note that when setting a home page, you MUST include the http or https prefix, or Firefox will ignore the policy. 14.3 Client Side Extension The Firefox Client Side Extension (CSE) creates 2 policy files. One at /usr/lib64/firefox/distribution/policies.json and the other at /etc/firefox/policies/policies.json. These files will contain exactly the same information. The only reason there is a duplicate, is because different versions of Firefox require the policy file in different locations.

The settings in Google Chrome will always be enforced. The settings in Default Settings will be distributed, but will not be enforced (users can modify these). For this example, let’s enforce a homepage. Select Google Chrome &gt; Startup, Home page and New Tab page.

Each entry contains a keyname, valuename, and data. for e in pol_conf.entries: print(e.keyname, e.valuename, e.data) Writing to the pol_conf can be tricky. If you write the length of the entries prior to writing the entries, it will actually cause memory corruption (this is a bug). So ensure you write to the entries, then to the length. You can create an entry using the preg import from samba.dcerpc. e = preg.entry() e.keyname = b&#39;Software\\\\Policies\\\\Samba\\\\smb_conf&#39; e.valuename = b&#39;apply group policies&#39; e.type = 4 # REG_DWORD, an integer e.data = 1 entries = list(pol_data.entries) entries.append(e) pol_data.entries = entries pol_data.num_entries = len(entries) # Ensure you set the new num_entries last The data type refers to Microsoft defined registry types: Registry type name Registry type value REG_NONE 0 REG_SZ 1 REG_EXPAND_SZ 2 REG_BINARY 3 REG_DWORD 4 REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN 5 REG_LINK 6 REG_MULTI_SZ 7 REG_RESOURCE_LIST 8 REG_QWORD 11 To write your changes back to the Registry.pol file, you’ll use the following: from samba.ndr import ndr_pack with open(&#39;Registry.pol&#39;, &#39;wb&#39;) as w: w.write(ndr_pack(pol_data)) "],["install-admx.html", "22 Installing Administrative Templates 22.1 Install Samba ADMX Templates 22.2 Installing Firefox ADMX Templates 22.3 Installing Chromium ADMX Templates 22.4 Installing Windows ADMX Templates", " 22 Installing Administrative Templates Administrative Templates allow you to define policies that can be administered from the Group Policy Management Editor.

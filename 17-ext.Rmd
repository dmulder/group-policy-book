# Writing Group Policy Extensions

The chapter will explain how to write a Group Policy Extension for Samba's Winbind. Group Policy is a delivery mechanism for distributing system settings and company policies to machines joined to an Active Directory domain. Unix/Linux machines running Samba's Winbind can also deploy these policies.

## Creating the Server Side Extension {#sse}

### Administrative Templates {#admx}

The first step to deploying Group Policy is to create a Server Side Extension (SSE). There are multiple ways to create an SSE, but here we'll only discuss Administrative Templates (ADMX). The purpose of the SSE is to deploy policies to the SYSVOL share. Theoretically, you could manually deploy any file (even plain text) to the SYSVOL and then write a Client Side Extension that parses it, but ADMX can be read and modified by the Group Policy Management Editor, which makes administration of policies simpler.

ADMX files are simply XML files which explain to the Group Policy Management Console how to display and store a policy in the SYSVOL. AMDX files always store policies in Registry.pol files. Samba provides a mechanism for parsing these, which we'll discuss later.

Below is a simple example of an ADMX template, and it's corresponding ADML file.

**samba.admx:**

```xml
<policyDefinitions revision="1.0" schemaVersion="1.0">
  <policyNamespaces>
    <using prefix="windows"
           namespace="Microsoft.Policies.Windows" />
  </policyNamespaces>

              displayName="$(string.CAT_SAMBA)" />
    <category name="CAT_UNIX_SETTINGS"
              displayName="$(string.CAT_UNIX_SETTINGS)">
      <parentCategory ref="CAT_SAMBA" />
    </category>
  </categories>
  <policies>
    <policy name="POL_DAILY_SCRIPTS" class="Machine"
            displayName="$(string.POL_DAILY_SCRIPTS)"
	    explainText="$(string.POL_DAILY_SCRIPTS_Help)"
	    presentation="$(presentation.POL_DAILY_SCRIPTS)"
	    key="Software\Policies\Samba\Unix Settings">

      <supportedOn ref="windows:SUPPORTED_WindowsVista" />
      <elements>
        <list id="LST_DAILY_SCRIPTS"
	      key="Software\Policies\Samba\
	           Unix Settings\Daily Scripts"
	      valueName="Daily Scripts" />
      </elements>
    </policy>
  </policies>
</policyDefinitions>
```

**en-US/samba.adml:**

```xml
<policyDefinitionResources revision="1.0" schemaVersion="1.0">

The meaning of the various tags are explained in Microsoft's Group Policy documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/admx-schema. Before the endless documentation and confusing XML scares you away, be aware there is an easier way!

#### ADMX Migrator

FullArmor created the ADMX Migrator to simplify the shift for system administrators from the old ADM policy templates to ADMX. Fortunately, this tool also serves our purpose for assisting us in easily creating these templates for our SSE. Unfortunately, the tool hasn't seen any development in the past 8 years, and wont run in Windows 10 (or any Unix/Linux platform, for that matter). I had to dredge up a Windows 7 VM in order to install and use the tool.

##### Creating the Administrative Template

1. Open ADMX Migrator

2. Right click on ADMX Templates in the left tree view, and click New Template.

3. Give your template a name, and click OK.

4. Right click on the new template in the left tree view, and click New Category.

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("ext-images/new-category.png")
```

5. Give the Category a name. This name will be displayed in the Group Policy Management Editor under Administrative Templates. You can choose to nest template under an existing category, or simply add it as a new root.

::: {#info style="color: green;"}
Note: You can also add sub-categories under this category. After clicking OK, right click the category you created and select New Category.
:::

6. Next, create your policy by right clicking on your new category, and selecting New Policy Setting.

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("ext-images/new-policy.png")
```

7. Because we'll be applying these settings to a Linux machine, the Registry fields are mostly meaningless, but they are required. Your policies will be stored under these keys on the SYSVOL in the Registry.pol file. Choose some sensible Registry Key, such as 'Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings', and a Registry Value Name, such as 'Daily Scripts' (these are the values used for Samba's cron.daily policy). The Display Name is the name that will be displayed for this policy in the Group Policy Management Editor. I usually make this the same as the Registry Value Name, but it doesn't need to be.

8. Select whether this policy will be applied to a Machine, a User, or to Both in the Class field. In our example, we could potentially set Both, then our Client Side Extension would need to handle both cron.daily scripts (the Machine) and also User crontab entries. Click OK for your policy to be created.

9. Your new policy will appear in the middle list view. Highlight it, and you will see a number of tabs below for configuring the policy.

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("ext-images/new-policy-list-view.png")
```

10. Select the Values tab and set the Enabled Value Type. In this case, we'll use String, since our cron commands will be saved to the Registry.pol as a string. In the Value field, you can set a default enabled value (this is optional).

11. Select the Presentation tab, right click in the Elements view, and click New Element > ListBox (or a different presentation, depending on the policy). If you look at the samba.adml file from the previous section, you'll notice that the presentationTable contains a listBox item. That's what we're creating here.

12. Choose an element Label, this will be the name for the list displayed in the Group Policy Management Editor.

13. Choose a Registry Key. This will be pre-populated with the parent Registry Key you gave when creating the policy. Append something to the key to make it unique. We'll use 'Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings\\Daily Scripts' for our cron.daily policy.

14. Navigate to the Explain tab, and add an explanation of what this policy is and what it does. This will be displayed to users in the Group Policy Management Editor.

15. Now right click on your template name in the left tree, and select Save As.

16. Finally, you'll need to deploy your new policy definition to the SYSVOL. It should be saved to the Policies\\PolicyDefinitions (the Group Policy Central Store) directory. These instructions from Microsoft can assist you in setting up your Group Policy Central Store.

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("ext-images/sse.png")
```

## Creating the Client Side Extension {#cse}

The following script defines a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) in Python, which will be called by Samba's Winbind to deploy our newly created policy. A CSE is a program that runs on a client machine and processes Group Policy Objects (GPOs) that are applied to the machine. The CSE processes the GPOs by applying the policies they contain to the client machine.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

    register_gp_extension, unregister_gp_extension,
    list_gp_extensions

from samba import getopt as options
import optparse

# Client Side Extension. To modify the contents of this file,
# modify the appropriate Group Policy objects which apply
# to this machine. DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE DIRECTLY.

```

The CSE is defined by the `gp_scripts_ext` class, which is derived from the `gp_pol_ext` and `gp_file_applier` classes. The `gp_pol_ext` class provides a framework for processing GPOs, and the `gp_file_applier` class provides functions for applying GPO policies to files on the client machine.

### The gp\_ext and gp\_applier Python Classes

Your CSE must be a class that inherits from subclasses of `gp_ext` and `gp_applier`. The `gp_pol_ext` is a subclass of `gp_ext` that provides simplified parsing of Registry.pol files. If you choose to store your policies in ini/inf files in the SYSVOL (instead of using Administrative Templates), then you can inherit from the `gp_inf_ext` instead. The `gp_file_applier` is a subclass of `gp_applier` which provides convenience functions for applying and unapplying policies which add files to the machine.

If your class inherits from either `gp_pol_ext` or `gp_inf_ext`, it has a `parse()` function defined, which takes a single filename. The parse() function will parse the contents of the policy file and return it in a sensible format.

If for some reason you choose to store data on the SYSVOL in some other format (such as in XML, etc), you'll need to subclass `gp_ext`, then implement a `read()` function, like this:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree
class gp_xml_ext(gp_ext):
    def read(self, data_file):
        return xml.etree.ElementTree.parse(data_file)
```

The `read()` function is called by `parse()`, passing it a local filename tied to the systems SYSVOL cache. Then within `process_group_policy()` you can call `parse()` to fetch the parsed data from the SYSVOL.

The `gp_file_applier` class implements the helper functions `apply` and `unapply`. If you instead inherit from `gp_applier` directly, you'll need to implement `apply` and `unapply` yourself. The `gp_applier` class provides various helper functions for assisting you in creating the `apply` and `unapply` functions.

### Process Group Policy

The CSE has two main functions: `process_group_policy` and `rsop`. The `process_group_policy` function is called by the Group Policy engine on the client machine to process the GPOs that apply to the machine. It takes two arguments: `deleted_gpo_list` and `changed_gpo_list`. The `deleted_gpo_list` argument is a list of GPOs that MUST be removed from the machine, and the `changed_gpo_list` argument is a list of GPOs that have been changed (or are new) and MUST be re-applied to the machine.

The `process_group_policy` function serves two primary purposes; it applies new policy, and it removes old policy. It first iterates over the `deleted_gpo_list`, using the unapply function from the `gp_file_applier` class to remove the files that were applied by the GPOs.

```python
for guid, settings in deleted_gpo_list:
    if str(self) in settings:
        for attribute, script in settings[str(self)].items():
            self.unapply(guid, attribute, script)
```

The `deleted_gpo_list` is a dictionary which contains the guids of Group Policy Objects, with associated settings which were previously applied. This list of applied settings is generated by the second loop (`changed_gpo_list`) while it is applying policy.

The `process_group_policy` function then iterates over the `changed_gpo_list`, applying the policies contained in the GPOs to the client machine. This second loop is a little more involved. When we iterate over `changed_gpo_list`, we're actually iterating over a list of GPO objects. The attributes of the object are:

* `gpo.name`: The GUID of the GPO.
* `gpo.file_sys_path`: A physical path to a cache of GPO on the local filesystem.

There are other methods and attributes, but these are the only ones important to a CSE.

The primary purpose of this loop is to iterate over the GPOs, read their policy in the SYSVOL, then check the sections for the Registry Key we created in our Server Side Extension. If our policy Registry Key exists, then we read the entry and apply the policy.

In our example, we find the 'Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings\\Daily Scripts' policy, then read the script contents from Registry.pol entry and write the script to a local file.

The `applier_func` function is called to apply the policies contained in the GPOs to the client machine. It takes two arguments: keyname and entries. The keyname argument is the name of the policy being applied, and the entries argument is a list of the policy entries. The function writes the policy entries to randomly generated file names in the appropriate cron directories on the client machine, and returns the names of the temporary files. The file names will be stored in the Group Policy Cache, for retrieving later for the `deleted_gpo_list`.

### Resultant Set of Policy

The `rsop` function in the extension is optional. It should return a dictionary containing key/value pairs of what our current policy will apply or has applied. The function is passed a list of GPO objects (similar to our `changed_gpo_list`), and we should parse the list similar to how we did in `process_group_policy`.

The `rsop` function generates the output for our Resultant Set of Policy. RSoP is a feature in Group Policy that allows you to determine the effective settings that are applied to a user or a computer as a result of Group Policy processing. RSoP provides a report that shows the policies that have been applied to the user or computer, as well as any conflicts or errors that may have occurred during Group Policy processing. RSoP can be used to troubleshoot Group Policy issues, to verify that the correct policies are being applied, and to determine the impact of Group Policy on a particular user or computer.

This function enables the `samba-gpupdate --rsop` command.

### Registering/Unregistering a Client Side Extension

The CSE also includes a function for registering and unregistering the CSE with the Group Policy engine on the client machine. While the example code provides a detailed example of how to register an extension, the basic requirement is simply to call `register_gp_extension()`.

```python
ext_guid = '{5930022C-94FF-4ED5-A403-CFB4549DB6F0}'
ext_path = os.path.realpath(__file__)
register_gp_extension(ext_guid, 'gp_scripts_ext', ext_path,
    smb_conf='/etc/samba/smb.conf', machine=True, user=False)
```

The extension guid can be any random guid. It simply must be unique among all extensions that you register to the host. The extension path is literally just the path to the source file containing your CSE.

You must pass your smb.conf file to the extension, so it knows where to store the list of registered extensions. You also must specify whether to apply this extension to the machine, or to individual users (or to both).

Unregistering the extension is simple. You call the `unregister_gp_extension()` and pass it the unique guid you previously chose which represents this CSE.

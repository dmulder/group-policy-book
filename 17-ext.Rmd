# Writing Group Policy Extensions

The chapter will explain how to write a Group Policy Extension for Samba's Winbind. Group Policy is a delivery mechanism for distributing system settings and company policies to machines joined to an Active Directory domain. Unix/Linux machines running Samba's Winbind can also deploy these policies.

## Creating the Server Side Extension {#sse}

### Administrative Templates {#admx}

The first step to deploying Group Policy is to create a Server Side Extension (SSE). There are multiple ways to create an SSE, but here we'll only discuss Administrative Templates (ADMX). The purpose of the SSE is to deploy policies to the SYSVOL share. Theoretically, you could manually deploy any file (even plain text) to the SYSVOL and then write a Client Side Extension that parses it, but ADMX can be read and modified by the Group Policy Management Editor, which makes administration of policies simpler.

ADMX files are simply XML files which explain to the Group Policy Management Console how to display and store a policy in the SYSVOL. AMDX files always store policies in Registry.pol files. Samba provides a mechanism for parsing these, which we'll discuss later.

Below is a simple example of an ADMX template, and it's corresponding ADML file.

**samba.admx:**

```xml
<policyDefinitions revision="1.0" schemaVersion="1.0">
  <policyNamespaces>
    <using prefix="windows"
           namespace="Microsoft.Policies.Windows" />
  </policyNamespaces>

    <category name="CAT_UNIX_SETTINGS"
              displayName="$(string.CAT_UNIX_SETTINGS)">
      <parentCategory ref="CAT_SAMBA" />
    </category>
  </categories>
  <policies>
    <policy name="POL_DAILY_SCRIPTS" class="Machine"
            displayName="$(string.POL_DAILY_SCRIPTS)"
	    explainText="$(string.POL_DAILY_SCRIPTS_Help)"
	    presentation="$(presentation.POL_DAILY_SCRIPTS)"
	    key="Software\Policies\Samba\Unix Settings">
      <parentCategory ref="CAT_UNIX_SETTINGS" />
      <supportedOn ref="windows:SUPPORTED_WindowsVista" />
      <elements>
        <list id="LST_DAILY_SCRIPTS"
	      key="Software\Policies\Samba\
	           Unix Settings\Daily Scripts"
	      valueName="Daily Scripts" />
      </elements>
    </policy>
  </policies>
</policyDefinitions>
```

**en-US/samba.adml:**

```xml
<policyDefinitionResources revision="1.0" schemaVersion="1.0">
  <displayName>
  </displayName>
  <description>
  </description>
  <resources>
    <stringTable>
      <string id="CAT_SAMBA">Samba</string>
      <string id="CAT_UNIX_SETTINGS">Unix Settings</string>
      <string id="POL_DAILY_SCRIPTS">Daily Scripts</string>
      <string id="POL_DAILY_SCRIPTS_Help">
        This policy setting allows you to execute commands, 
        either local or on remote storage, daily.
      </string>
    </stringTable>
    <presentationTable>
      <presentation id="POL_DAILY_SCRIPTS">

	  Script and arguments
        </listBox>
      </presentation>
    </presentationTable>
  </resources>
</policyDefinitionResources>
```

The meaning of the various tags are explained in Microsoft's Group Policy documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/admx-schema. Before the endless documentation and confusing XML scares you away, be aware there is an easier way!

#### ADMX Migrator

FullArmor created the ADMX Migrator to simplify the shift for system administrators from the old ADM policy templates to ADMX. Fortunately, this tool also serves our purpose for assisting us in easily creating these templates for our SSE. Unfortunately, the tool hasn't seen any development in the past 8 years, and wont run in Windows 10 (or any Unix/Linux platform, for that matter). I had to dredge up a Windows 7 VM in order to install and use the tool.

##### Creating the Administrative Template

1. Open ADMX Migrator

2. Right click on ADMX Templates in the left tree view, and click New Template.

3. Give your template a name, and click OK.

4. Right click on the new template in the left tree view, and click New Category.

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("ext-images/new-category.png")
```

5. Give the Category a name. This name will be displayed in the Group Policy Management Editor under Administrative Templates. You can choose to nest template under an existing category, or simply add it as a new root.

::: {#info style="color: green;"}
Note: You can also add sub-categories under this category. After clicking OK, right click the category you created and select New Category.
:::

6. Next, create your policy by right clicking on your new category, and selecting New Policy Setting.

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("ext-images/new-policy.png")
```

7. Because we'll be applying these settings to a Linux machine, the Registry fields are mostly meaningless, but they are required. Your policies will be stored under these keys on the SYSVOL in the Registry.pol file. Choose some sensible Registry Key, such as 'Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings', and a Registry Value Name, such as 'Daily Scripts' (these are the values used for Samba's cron.daily policy). The Display Name is the name that will be displayed for this policy in the Group Policy Management Editor. I usually make this the same as the Registry Value Name, but it doesn't need to be.

8. Select whether this policy will be applied to a Machine, a User, or to Both in the Class field. In our example, we could potentially set Both, then our Client Side Extension would need to handle both cron.daily scripts (the Machine) and also User crontab entries. Click OK for your policy to be created.

9. Your new policy will appear in the middle list view. Highlight it, and you will see a number of tabs below for configuring the policy.

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("ext-images/new-policy-list-view.png")
```

10. Select the Values tab and set the Enabled Value Type. In this case, we'll use String, since our cron commands will be saved to the Registry.pol as a string. In the Value field, you can set a default enabled value (this is optional).

11. Select the Presentation tab, right click in the Elements view, and click New Element > ListBox (or a different presentation, depending on the policy). If you look at the samba.adml file from the previous section, you'll notice that the presentationTable contains a listBox item. That's what we're creating here.

12. Choose an element Label, this will be the name for the list displayed in the Group Policy Management Editor.

13. Choose a Registry Key. This will be pre-populated with the parent Registry Key you gave when creating the policy. Append something to the key to make it unique. We'll use 'Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings\\Daily Scripts' for our cron.daily policy.

14. Navigate to the Explain tab, and add an explanation of what this policy is and what it does. This will be displayed to users in the Group Policy Management Editor.

15. Now right click on your template name in the left tree, and select Save As.

16. Finally, you'll need to deploy your new policy definition to the SYSVOL. It should be saved to the Policies\\PolicyDefinitions (the Group Policy Central Store) directory. These instructions from Microsoft can assist you in setting up your Group Policy Central Store.

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.pos = 'H'}
knitr::include_graphics("ext-images/sse.png")
```

### samba-tool gpo manage

The `samba-tool gpo manage` command is a tool provided by the Samba team for managing Group Policy Objects (GPOs). This command provides a number of subcommands that allow you to add, remove, and list policies within a GPO.

Adding subcommands to `samba-tool gpo manage` is one way to create a Server Side Extension (SSE) for Group Policy. Each `samba-tool gpo manage` command generally provides 3 subcommands for each policy; add, remove, and list. These subcommands allow you to add new policies to a GPO, remove existing policies from a GPO, and list the policies that are currently configured in a GPO.

Group Policy SSEs should be added to `samba-tool` in the `python/samba/netcmd/gpo.py` file.

#### Subcommands

To add python subcommands using the `SuperCommand` class, you will need to create a new class that inherits from the `SuperCommand` class, and define a subcommands attribute that lists the subcommands that are supported by your command.  The subcommands attribute will be a dictionary containing keys with new command names, paired with instances of `Command` classes which implement the command.

For example:

```python
class cmd_scripts(SuperCommand):
    """Manage Scripts Group Policy Objects"""
    subcommands = {}
    subcommands["add"] = cmd_add_script()
    subcommands["list"] = cmd_list_script()
    subcommands["remove"] = cmd_remove_script()
```

Your `SuperCommand` will then need to be tied into an existing `samba-tool` command, for example:

```python
class cmd_manage(SuperCommand):
    """Manage Group Policy Objects"""
    subcommands = {}
    subcommands["sudoers"] = cmd_sudoers()
    subcommands["security"] = cmd_security()
    subcommands["smb_conf"] = cmd_smb_conf()
    subcommands["symlink"] = cmd_symlink()
    subcommands["files"] = cmd_files()
    subcommands["openssh"] = cmd_openssh()
    subcommands["motd"] = cmd_motd()
    subcommands["issue"] = cmd_issue()
    subcommands["access"] = cmd_access()
    subcommands["scripts"] = cmd_scripts()
```

Notice that the `cmd_scripts` `SuperCommand` from earlier has been appended to the `cmd_manage` list of `subcommands`.

##### Implementing an Add Subcommand

To write a command that adds a new policy to a Group Policy Object (GPO), you will need to create a class that inherits from the Command class provided by the samba.netcmd module, and define a run method that takes a series of arguments and options, and contains the code that will be executed when the command is run.

The run method should begin by connecting to a Domain Controller (DC) using the `smb_connection` function defined in `python/samba/netcmd/gpo.py`. It can then retrieve the data from the GPO's Registry.pol file using the loadfile method of the connection object returned by the `smb_connection` function, or create a new file object if the file does not exist.

Next, the method can parse the data in the `Registry.pol` file using the `ndr_unpack` function from the `samba.ndr` module, which will return a file object representing the data in the file. We will then add a key to the list of entries in `Registry.pol` file object.

Finally, we save the modified file object back to the GPO's `Registry.pol` file on the DC using the savefile method of the connection object.

The class should also define a synopsis attribute, which provides a brief summary of the command.

Here is an example of what it might look:

```python
class cmd_add_script(Command):
    """Adds Script Group Policy to the sysvol

This command adds a script policy to the sysvol.

Example:
samba-tool gpo manage scripts add \
 {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} MACHINE daily \
 test_script.sh '\\-n \\-p all'

policy_class is defined as either MACHINE or USER.
freq is defined as either Daily, Monthly, Weekly, or Hourly.
    """

    synopsis = "%prog <gpo> <policy_class> <freq> <script> "
               "[args] [options]"

    takes_optiongroups = {
        "sambaopts": options.SambaOptions,
        "versionopts": options.VersionOptions,
        "credopts": options.CredentialsOptions,
    }

    takes_options = [
        Option("-H", "--URL",

            raise CommandError("'%s' is not a valid frequency. "
                "Choose from Daily, Monthly, Weekly, or "
		"Hourly" % freq)

        self.lp = sambaopts.get_loadparm()
        self.creds = credopts.get_credentials(self.lp,
                                          fallback_machine=True)

        if not os.path.exists(script):
            raise CommandError(
                "Script '%s' does not exist" % script)

        # We need to know writable DC to setup SMB connection
        if H and H.startswith('ldap://'):
            dc_hostname = H[7:]
            self.url = H
        else:
            dc_hostname = netcmd_finddc(self.lp, self.creds)
            self.url = dc_url(self.lp, self.creds, dc=dc_hostname)

                              lp=self.lp,

        realm = self.lp.get('realm')
        pol_file = '\\'.join([realm.lower(), 'Policies', gpo,
                              '%s\\Registry.pol' % policy_class])
        try:

            if e.args[0] in [NT_STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_INVALID,

                           args if args is not None else '')
        e = preg.entry()
        e.keyname = keyname
        e.valuename = reg_key

        entries = list(pol_data.entries)
        entries.append(e)
        pol_data.num_entries = len(entries)
        pol_data.entries = entries

        try:
            conn.savefile(pol_file, ndr_pack(pol_data))
        except NTSTATUSError as e:

                raise CommandError("The authenticated user does "
                               "not have sufficient privileges")
            raise
```

##### Implementing a List Subcommand

To write a command that lists the policies for a Group Policy Object (GPO), you would need to create a class that inherits from the `Command` class provided by the `samba.netcmd` module, and define a `run` method that takes a series of arguments and options, and contains the code that will be executed when the command is run.

The run method should begin by connecting to a Domain Controller (DC) using the `smb_connection` function defined in `python/samba/netcmd/gpo.py`. It can then retrieve the data from the GPO's Registry.pol file using the loadfile method of the connection object returned by the `smb_connection` function.

Next, the method can parse the data in the `Registry.pol` file using the `ndr_unpack` function from the `samba.ndr` module, which will return a file object representing the data in the file. The method can then iterate over the keys and values in the file object, printing out the names and data for each key.

The class should also define a synopsis attribute, which provides a brief summary of the command.

Here is an example of what it might look:

```python
class cmd_list_script(Command):
    """List Script Group Policy from the sysvol

This command lists the script policies currently set on the sysvol.

Example:
samba-tool gpo manage scripts list \
 {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}
    """

    synopsis = "%prog <gpo> [options]"

    takes_optiongroups = {
        "sambaopts": options.SambaOptions,
        "versionopts": options.VersionOptions,
        "credopts": options.CredentialsOptions,
    }

    takes_options = [
        Option("-H", "--URL",
               help="LDB URL for database or target server",
	       type=str, metavar="URL", dest="H"),
    ]

    takes_args = ["gpo"]

    def run(self, gpo, H=None, sambaopts=None, credopts=None,
            versionopts=None):
        self.lp = sambaopts.get_loadparm()
        self.creds = credopts.get_credentials(self.lp,
                                          fallback_machine=True)

        # We need to know writable DC to setup SMB connection
        if H and H.startswith('ldap://'):
            dc_hostname = H[7:]
            self.url = H
        else:
            dc_hostname = netcmd_finddc(self.lp, self.creds)
            self.url = dc_url(self.lp, self.creds, dc=dc_hostname)

        # SMB connect to DC
        conn = smb_connection(dc_hostname,
                              'sysvol',
                              lp=self.lp,
                              creds=self.creds)

        realm = self.lp.get('realm')
        pol_file = '\\'.join([realm.lower(), 'Policies', gpo,
                              '%s\\Registry.pol'])
        for policy_class in ['MACHINE', 'USER']:
            self.outf.write('%s:\n' % policy_class)
            try:
                pol_data = ndr_unpack(preg.file,
                          conn.loadfile(pol_file % policy_class))
            except NTSTATUSError as e:
                if e.args[0] in [NT_STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_INVALID,

                                 NT_STATUS_OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND]:
                    # The file doesn't exist,
		    # so there is nothing to list
                    continue
                elif e.args[0] == NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED:
                    raise CommandError("The authenticated user "
                        "does not have sufficient privileges")
                else:
                    raise

            reg_key = 'Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings'
            for e in pol_data.entries:
                if e.valuename == "**delvals.":
                    continue
                if e.keyname.startswith(reg_key) and \
                        e.keyname.endswith('Scripts'):
                    self.outf.write("\t%s:\n" % e.keyname)
                    self.outf.write("\t\t%s\n" % e.data)
```

##### Implementing a Remove Subcommand

To write a command that removes a policy from a Group Policy Object (GPO), you would need to create a class that inherits from the `Command` class provided by the `samba.netcmd` module, and define a `run` method that takes a series of arguments and options, and contains the code that will be executed when the command is run.

The run method should begin by connecting to a Domain Controller (DC) using the `smb_connection` function defined in `python/samba/netcmd/gpo.py`. It can then retrieve the data from the GPO's Registry.pol file using the loadfile method of the connection object returned by the `smb_connection` function.

Next, the method can parse the data in the Registry.pol file using the `ndr_unpack` function, which will return a file object representing the data in the file. It then checks whether the entry specified in the "script" variable exists in the list of entries contained in the `pol_data` object. If the entry does exist, it is removed from the list and the number of entries in the list is updated.

Finally, we save the modified file object back to the GPO's `Registry.pol` file on the DC using the savefile method of the connection object.

The class should also define a synopsis attribute, which provides a brief summary of the command.

Here is an example of what it might look:

```python
class cmd_remove_script(Command):
    """Removes Script Group Policy from the sysvol

This command removes a script policy from the sysvol.

## Creating the Client Side Extension {#cse}

The following script defines a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) in Python, which will be called by Samba's Winbind to deploy our newly created policy. A CSE is a program that runs on a client machine and processes Group Policy Objects (GPOs) that are applied to the machine. The CSE processes the GPOs by applying the policies they contain to the client machine.

The CSE is defined by the `gp_scripts_ext` class, which is derived from the `gp_pol_ext` and `gp_file_applier` classes. The `gp_pol_ext` class provides a framework for processing GPOs, and the `gp_file_applier` class provides functions for applying GPO policies to files on the client machine.

### The gp\_ext and gp\_applier Python Classes

Your CSE must be a class that inherits from subclasses of `gp_ext` and `gp_applier`. The `gp_pol_ext` is a subclass of `gp_ext` that provides simplified parsing of Registry.pol files. If you choose to store your policies in ini/inf files in the SYSVOL (instead of using Administrative Templates), then you can inherit from the `gp_inf_ext` instead. The `gp_file_applier` is a subclass of `gp_applier` which provides convenience functions for applying and unapplying policies which add files to the machine.

If your class inherits from either `gp_pol_ext` or `gp_inf_ext`, it has a `parse()` function defined, which takes a single filename. The parse() function will parse the contents of the policy file and return it in a sensible format.

If for some reason you choose to store data on the SYSVOL in some other format (such as in XML, etc), you'll need to subclass `gp_ext`, then implement a `read()` function, like this:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree
class gp_xml_ext(gp_ext):
    def read(self, data_file):
        return xml.etree.ElementTree.parse(data_file)
```

The `read()` function is called by `parse()`, passing it a local filename tied to the systems SYSVOL cache. Then within `process_group_policy()` you can call `parse()` to fetch the parsed data from the SYSVOL.

The `gp_file_applier` class implements the helper functions `apply` and `unapply`. If you instead inherit from `gp_applier` directly, you'll need to implement `apply` and `unapply` yourself. The `gp_applier` class provides various helper functions for assisting you in creating the `apply` and `unapply` functions.

### Process Group Policy

The CSE has two main functions: `process_group_policy` and `rsop`. The `process_group_policy` function is called by the Group Policy engine on the client machine to process the GPOs that apply to the machine. It takes two arguments: `deleted_gpo_list` and `changed_gpo_list`. The `deleted_gpo_list` argument is a list of GPOs that MUST be removed from the machine, and the `changed_gpo_list` argument is a list of GPOs that have been changed (or are new) and MUST be re-applied to the machine.

The `process_group_policy` function serves two primary purposes; it applies new policy, and it removes old policy. It first iterates over the `deleted_gpo_list`, using the unapply function from the `gp_file_applier` class to remove the files that were applied by the GPOs.

```python
for guid, settings in deleted_gpo_list:
    if str(self) in settings:
        for attribute, script in settings[str(self)].items():
            self.unapply(guid, attribute, script)
```

The `deleted_gpo_list` is a dictionary which contains the guids of Group Policy Objects, with associated settings which were previously applied. This list of applied settings is generated by the second loop (`changed_gpo_list`) while it is applying policy.

The `process_group_policy` function then iterates over the `changed_gpo_list`, applying the policies contained in the GPOs to the client machine. This second loop is a little more involved. When we iterate over `changed_gpo_list`, we're actually iterating over a list of GPO objects. The attributes of the object are:

* `gpo.name`: The GUID of the GPO.
* `gpo.file_sys_path`: A physical path to a cache of GPO on the local filesystem.

There are other methods and attributes, but these are the only ones important to a CSE.

The primary purpose of this loop is to iterate over the GPOs, read their policy in the SYSVOL, then check the sections for the Registry Key we created in our Server Side Extension. If our policy Registry Key exists, then we read the entry and apply the policy.

In our example, we find the 'Software\\Policies\\Samba\\Unix Settings\\Daily Scripts' policy, then read the script contents from Registry.pol entry and write the script to a local file.

The `applier_func` function is called to apply the policies contained in the GPOs to the client machine. It takes two arguments: keyname and entries. The keyname argument is the name of the policy being applied, and the entries argument is a list of the policy entries. The function writes the policy entries to randomly generated file names in the appropriate cron directories on the client machine, and returns the names of the temporary files. The file names will be stored in the Group Policy Cache, for retrieving later for the `deleted_gpo_list`.

### Resultant Set of Policy

The `rsop` function in the extension is optional. It should return a dictionary containing key/value pairs of what our current policy will apply or has applied. The function is passed a list of GPO objects (similar to our `changed_gpo_list`), and we should parse the list similar to how we did in `process_group_policy`.

The `rsop` function generates the output for our Resultant Set of Policy. RSoP is a feature in Group Policy that allows you to determine the effective settings that are applied to a user or a computer as a result of Group Policy processing. RSoP provides a report that shows the policies that have been applied to the user or computer, as well as any conflicts or errors that may have occurred during Group Policy processing. RSoP can be used to troubleshoot Group Policy issues, to verify that the correct policies are being applied, and to determine the impact of Group Policy on a particular user or computer.

This function enables the `samba-gpupdate --rsop` command.

### Registering/Unregistering a Client Side Extension

The CSE also includes a function for registering and unregistering the CSE with the Group Policy engine on the client machine. While the example code provides a detailed example of how to register an extension, the basic requirement is simply to call `register_gp_extension()`.

```python
ext_guid = '{5930022C-94FF-4ED5-A403-CFB4549DB6F0}'
ext_path = os.path.realpath(__file__)
register_gp_extension(ext_guid, 'gp_scripts_ext', ext_path,
    smb_conf='/etc/samba/smb.conf', machine=True, user=False)
```

The extension guid can be any random guid. It simply must be unique among all extensions that you register to the host. The extension path is literally just the path to the source file containing your CSE.

You must pass your smb.conf file to the extension, so it knows where to store the list of registered extensions. You also must specify whether to apply this extension to the machine, or to individual users (or to both).

Unregistering the extension is simple. You call the `unregister_gp_extension()` and pass it the unique guid you previously chose which represents this CSE.

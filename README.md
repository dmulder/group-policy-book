# How to read the book

You can purchase a [physical copy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRPZTMVK), which is sold at-cost (in accordance with the license), you can [read the web version](https://dmulder.github.io/group-policy-book), or you can download the [pdf or epub](https://github.com/dmulder/group-policy-book/releases) from the Releases page.

# Building the book

The book itself is built using bookdown, which is part of RStudio.

You can build the pdf via `make pdf`, the ebook via `make epub` and the web version via `make website`.

To modify the cover.pdf, you'll need to install the [Google Font Squada One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Squada+One). Download it, extract it, and move SquadaOne-Regular.ttf to ~/.local/share/fonts/.

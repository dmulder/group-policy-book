# Password and Kerberos Policies {#sec}

The purpose of these policies is to enforce password complexity and kerberos rules on a Samba Active Directory Domain Controller (ADDC). When a Linux client is not an ADDC, these policies are disabled and ignored automatically.

## Server Side Extension

The Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) contains a built in Server Side Extension for Password and Kerberos Policies. There is also a `samba-tool` command to modify these policies.

### Managing Password and Kerberos Policies via the GPME

Open the GPME and navigate to `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policy`.

The following password policies are applicable to a Samba ADDC:

* Maximum password age
* Minimum password age
* Minimum password length
* Password must meet complexity requirements

The following Kerberos policies are applicable to a Samba ADDC:

* Maximum lifetime for service ticket
* Maximum lifetime for user ticket
* Maximum lifetime for user ticket renewal

### Managing Password and Kerberos Policies via samba-tool

The Password and Kerberos policies can also be set via `samba-tool`.

```
> samba-tool gpo manage security set --help
Usage: samba-tool gpo manage security set <gpo> <setting> <value> [options]

Set Samba Security Group Policy to the sysvol

This command sets a security setting to the sysvol for applying to winbind
clients. Not providing a value will unset the policy.
These settings only apply to the ADDC.

Example:
samba-tool gpo manage security set {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9} MaxTicketAge 10

Possible policies:
MaxTicketAge            Maximum lifetime for user ticket
                        Defined in hours

MaxServiceAge           Maximum lifetime for service ticket
                        Defined in minutes

MaxRenewAge             Maximum lifetime for user ticket renewal
                        Defined in minutes

MinimumPasswordAge      Minimum password age
                        Defined in days

MaximumPasswordAge      Maximum password age
                        Defined in days

MinimumPasswordLength   Minimum password length
                        Defined in characters

PasswordComplexity      Password must meet complexity requirements
                        1 is Enabled, 0 is Disabled
```

# Certificate Auto Enrollment {#certautoenroll}

Certificate Auto Enrollment allows devices to enroll for certificates from Active Directory Certificate Services. As of Samba 4.16, Linux clients can now auto enroll for certificates just like a Windows client.

Samba’s Certificate Auto Enrollment uses the certmonger service to keep track of certificates. It also uses the cepces plugin to certmonger. The sscep command is also used to download the trust chain.

Certificate Auto Enrollment is compatible with both Winbind and SSSD.

Certificate Auto Enrollment is initiated using Samba’s Group Policy client, samba-gpupdate.

## Configuring Certificate Auto Enrollment on the Server

The Windows server roles Certification Authority, Certificate Enrollment Policy Web Service, and Certificate Enrollment Web Service all must be installed and configured. Optionally the role Network Device Enrollment Service can be installed to simplify the fetching of the root certificate chain.

## Enable Certificate Auto Enrollment on the Client

To setup Certificate Auto Enrollment:

1. Install certmonger and cepces. Optionally also install sscep to simplify fetching of the certificate root chain. Samba uses certmonger paired with cepces to monitor the host certificate templates.
2. Join to an Active Directory domain (one where the CA has been previously configured as explained above).
3. Enable group policy apply:
* For a Winbind joined machine by setting the smb.conf global parameter 'apply group policies = yes'.
* For a SSSD joined machine by installing the oddjob-gpupdate package.
4. To verify Certificate Auto Enrollment is correctly configured, issue the command `/usr/sbin/samba-gpupdate --rsop`
```

Issuing the `getcert list` command will display the installed certificates:

## Where to find certificates

Certificates are installed in /var/lib/samba/certs and private keys are installed in /var/lib/samba/private/certs.

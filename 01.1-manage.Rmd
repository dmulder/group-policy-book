# Managing Group Policies {#manage}

Before diving into specific Group Policies, let's review the basics of managing Group Policy.

A Windows Active Directory Administrator should know that Group Policies are managed via the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC). Unfortunately there isn't a similar tool for Samba Active Directory Administrators. The Samba project does provide the comprehensive `samba-tool gpo` command, which supplants much of the GPMC.

There are instances where Samba's Group Policy can only be managed via the GPMC, with no `samba-tool gpo` alternative. These cases will be highlighted in the text.

# Script Policies {#scripts}

The purpose of this policy is to schedule cron jobs on a Linux client. Both Machine and User policy is supported. This policy does not upload a script for execution, it only schedules an existing script to run. To first load a script onto the client, see the Files Policy in chapter \@ref(files).

This policy is physically stored on the SYSVOL in the **MACHINE/Registry.pol** and **USER/Registry.pol** files within the subdirectory of the Group Policy Object. It is stored in registry format. See chapter \@ref(regpol) for details on how to manually modify this file.

## Server Side Extension

The Server Side Extension for smb.conf policies is distributed using Administrative Templates (ADMX). Refer to chapter \@ref(sse) in section \@ref(admx) for details about Administrative Templates.

Setting up the ADMX templates for this policy is described in chapter \@ref(smbconf) section \@ref(smbconf-sse).

### Managing Machine Scripts Policies via the GPME

Open the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) and navigate to `Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Samba > Unix Settings > Scripts`. For instructions on accessing the GPME, see chapter \@ref(manage) section \@ref(gpcreate).

As an example, we'll create a simple cron job which echo's "hello world" once every day.

### Managing User Scripts Policies via the GPME

Next we'll create a user script that echo's the text "Don't do that Dave" every hour. Open the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) and navigate to `User Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Samba > Unix Settings > Scripts`.
